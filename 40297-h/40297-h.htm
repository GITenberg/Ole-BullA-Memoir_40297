<h2><a name="NOTE" id="NOTE">NOTE.</a></h2>


<p>In preparing this memoir my aim has been to use
incidents, criticisms, and tributes which brought out
characteristic traits, as recognized by others as well as
myself, and to supply only what was needed to make
the sequence clear. Many poems and tributes, and
much musical criticism, have been necessarily omitted
for want of space. So far as possible, writers have been
credited when quoted, but I desire to make still further
acknowledgment to Wergeland, Winter Hjelm, Goldschmidt,
Mr. Henry Norman, and Professor R. B. Anderson,
who prepared a sketch of Norwegian history,
which has been given in a more condensed form.</p>

<p>Ole Bull was in Sweden years ago when the &#8220;union
mark&#8221; was adopted, for use in the Norwegian and
Swedish flags. He would himself never float any but
the pure Norwegian colors, and, from the first, was
most earnest and pronounced in his opinion that none
but the naval and customs flags should have the union
mark, as the two countries were politically united only
in their relations to foreign powers. For years he was
almost alone in this feeling, but the subject has recently
given rise to much debate, and even heated controversy.
I speak of this here, because a paragraph relating
to the matter was omitted by mistake from the
body of the book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span></p>

<p>I cannot too warmly express my thanks for the help
and encouragement given by friends. It is in especial
recognition of the careful interest he has shown that I
mention my obligation to Mr. Walter E. Colton. The
admiration for his work and original research, united to
a great personal regard and affection felt for him by my
husband, made me desire to place in his hands the
&#8220;Violin Notes,&#8221; and it should be added that Mr. Colton
has filled out the Note on the varnish, as he alone could
have done. In Dr. Crosby&#8217;s unfinished paper the bow
arm and hand were not treated, and the Tartini letter is
added because Ole Bull considered it the best instruction
ever offered for the use of the bow. Mr. Fields&#8217;s
tribute was sent from his sick&#8211;room, so constant and
unfailing was he ever in his thought of others. Members
of my husband&#8217;s family have given me anecdotes
and helped to verify many incidents, and Mr. Alexander
Bull kindly placed at my disposal the correspondence of
his parents. To Mrs. Botta I owe the beautiful drawing
made for her by Mr. Darley, at the time of Ole
Bull&#8217;s first visit to the United States. The engraved
portrait is by Mr. J. A. J. Wilcox, from a photograph
by Mora, taken in 1878. The illustrations for the &#8220;Violin
Notes,&#8221; from photographs by Mora, have necessarily
lost in the reproduction something of their original
beauty of outline and form, but they serve well the purpose
for which they are inserted.</p>

<p>To all whose friendly services are mentioned in these
pages, and to many not named, I make my grateful acknowledgment;
and also to Mr. W. J. Rolfe, for kind
assistance in seeing this memoir through the press.</p>

<p>The quaint, picturesque old city of Bergen,
surrounded by its &#8220;seven mountains,&#8221; has been
the birthplace of many famous Norsemen, among
them Holberg and Welhaven, names that have a
more than national repute. In no other city of
the North has been preserved so much of the atmosphere
of the olden time and history.</p>

<p>All who know Bergen think of its seven mountains
as shrouded in mist most of the year; but
where else can one find such brilliant, sunny summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
days, such pure, sweet air, fragrant with the
breath of field and <i>fjeld</i>? Or who can forget the
harbor as seen from the deck of a vessel slowly
gliding in of a summer evening, when every tint
of sunset sky is caught and reflected by the sea
and the rocky mountain tops, and it seems the
entrance to an enchanted land?</p>

<p>Its climate, as Jonas Lie has said, illustrates its
folk&#8211;type; doubtless because it has helped to form
it. The people are animated, enthusiastic, and
practical, a curious combination of the prosaic and
ideal; and all this, it is claimed, has made the old
town rich in men of genius. Her children have
been loyal; and the old mother, with her thousand
years&#8217; history, has had no more devoted son than
Ole Bull.</p>

<p>He was born February 5, 1810. His paternal
grandmother, Gedsken Edvardine Storm, married
to the apothecary and army surgeon, Ole Bornemann
Bull, was sister to the poet, Edvard Storm.
His father, Johan Storm Bull, like his father before
him a physician and apothecary in Bergen,
was an accomplished man, and a chemist of unusual
ability. He had studied under Tromsdorf,
and corresponded with the first German specialists
of his day. His mother, Anna Dorothea
Bull, was of the old Dutch family Geelmuyden.
Her father, an able lawyer, died before the age of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
forty, leaving his widow with several children to
rear alone; and of her four sons, two were captains
in the army, one was a sea&#8211;captain, and one,
&#8220;Uncle Jens,&#8221; for some years a merchant, and
afterwards the publisher of the city&#8217;s first newspaper,
which is still owned by the family. The
three leading professions were all represented by
members of the Bull and Geelmuyden families.
Johan Randulf Bull, the brother of Ole&#8217;s grandfather,
had, beside other offices, filled that of governor
of the Bergen <i>stift</i>, or diocese, and had been
noted for his generous hospitality.</p>

<p>Ole Bull was the eldest of ten children, seven
sons and three daughters, nine of whom lived to
the age of maturity, and six of whom survive him.</p>

<p>He was sent early to the Latin school, as the
children of gentlemen usually were at that time;
but the promise he gave can be inferred from the
advice of his old rector, Mr. Winding, some years
after: &#8220;Take to your fiddle in earnest, boy, and
don&#8217;t waste your time here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both of Ole&#8217;s parents, and several members of
the family on the mother&#8217;s side, were musical.
His father kept up the proverbial hospitality of
the family, and no gatherings were more enjoyable
than Uncle Jens&#8217;s Tuesday quartette evenings.
Uncle Jens spent much time and money to
gratify his passion for music. On the quartette<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
evenings Ole was several times discovered, by an
involuntary movement, under the table or sofa, or
behind a curtain, where, having crept from his
bed, he had concealed himself for hours, only to
be ignominiously sent back again, after a whipping
for disobedience. But, stern as was the discipline
of that day, an exception was after a time
made in his favor, through the intercession of
Uncle Jens. He thus became familiar, while very
young, with the quartettes of Krummer, Haydn,
Mozart, and Beethoven, and, as he used to say,
imbibed the rules of art unknowingly; for he did
not conceive the music as produced by players,
but as proceeding from the instruments played,
jubilating, triumphing, quarreling, fighting, with a
life of their own,&#8212;a conception arising, no doubt,
partly from the tales his grandmother told him of
the elves and gnomes, with which the popular
myths peopled forest and mountain. When, in
early childhood, playing alone in the meadow, he
saw a delicate blue&#8211;bell gently moving in the
breeze, he fancied he heard the bell ring, and the
grass accompany it with most enrapturing fine
voices; <i>he fancied he heard nature sing</i>, and thus
music revealed itself, or came to his consciousness
as something that might be reproduced.</p>

<p>The influence which the popular music and mythology
must have had upon a sensitive and imaginative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
child like Ole can hardly be understood
by those who have been born and bred in England
and America, where folk&#8211;songs and folk&#8211;lore
are now almost unknown. Mr. Goldschmidt, in
an article on Ole Bull in &#8220;Macmillan&#8217;s Magazine,&#8221;
remarks:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When, on my visits to England, I had been some
time in London, in the eastern counties, in Surrey, in
Kent, and in the Isle of Wight, it struck me that in my
strolls through streets and lanes, high&#8211;roads and woods,
I had never heard the people sing. I certainly had
heard, for instance, the black minstrels and such other
bands; but I do not call that a singing of the people,
but a more or less bad execution of individual compositions.
The people&#8217;s song descends from the air; it
rushes forth from the forests, the rivers, the mountains;
it lives in tradition; it was never composed, never
taught man by man. I remember when once, with a
friend, passing over Tower Hill, hearing a plaintive
sound proceeding from a crowd. I asked him what was
the matter, and on being told, &#8220;A ballad singer,&#8221; I
hastened to the spot to catch a musical sound, however
coarse, from the people of England. Alas, it was only
a poor, starving woman crying out for bread, and in
false rhythms offering printed ballads for sale. My
thoughts reverted to the time when I visited Norway,
and when, having crossed the Farn Tinn Lake and entered
Vestfiorddal, Aagot, the daughter of my host, at
dusk took down the <i>langeley</i> and sang. Oh, for those
sweet, simple lays of love and feuds, fragrant with <i>naïve</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
faith in a mysterious destiny, that selects the best hearts,
the loveliest girl, and the bravest lad for the greatest
joy and the deepest pain! As for the strain, the music
itself, if you were to ask Aagot who made it, she would
not tell it to a stranger; but perhaps later, when you
had won her confidence and made her trust you were
no unbeliever, no &#8220;scorner of simple folks,&#8221; she would
tell you that her great&#8211;grandmother had the melody
from a man whose great&#8211;grandfather had learnt it of
the Fossekarl (the spirit of the waterfall), or from the
<span lang="no">Hulder</span>, the mysterious, ever&#8211;young shepherdess, who
had fallen in love with him! If, then, you asked Aagot
whether she believed in the existence of Fossekarl and
Hulder, she would answer, &#8220;The parson says such beings
are not, but my grandmother knew a man who had
seen them.&#8221;</p>

<p>I have learnt from the papers that very superstitious
people are found in parts of England; so that, if superstition
made music, you should be a singing people still.
The question, however, is, Were you ever so? I feel
assured you were; how else could your country have
been called &#8220;Merry England&#8221;? But since that time
more than two centuries have laid on you hard work
and great cares; you have become an industrious, laborious
people; you truly earn your bread in the sweat of
your brow; the locomotive rattles on your rails, the
steam&#8211;engine pants in your factories, the steam&#8211;hammer
clangs. So when I see the people on a Saturday night
pouring forth from these workshops, and going to lay
in their stock of provisions for Sunday, I fully understand
that song has left them, and that their children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
have no leisure to learn the strains of their great&#8211;grandmothers:&#8212;</p>

<p>
&#8220;For they who kept us captives bade us sing;<br />
But how could we sing?&#8221;<br />
</p>

<p>In Norway, at present, steam draws a broad furrow
across the land. It whistles on the railroad; it plies on
the lakes; it knocks thrice at the mountain, and the
mountain&#8211;king, opening his gate, admits the broad light
of day, in which, according to the legends of old, he
must die. Already the lovers of song complain of its
retreat, and, following it to remote valleys, watch its
dying lips to set it down in notes. But meanwhile a
great representative of Nature&#8217;s music, of the people&#8217;s
song, had gone forth to the wide world,&#8212;Ole Bull.</p></div>

<p>Uncle Jens played the violoncello well, and had
a collection of instruments. He loved to amuse
himself with little Ole&#8217;s extreme susceptibility to
music. When he was three years old, Jens often
put him in the violoncello case, and hired him
with sweetmeats to stay there while he played.
But the candy could not keep him quiet long.
The eyes kindled, and the little feet began to beat
time. At last his nervous excitement prevented
his staying longer in the case. The music was
dancing all through him, and he must give it
utterance. Running home, he would seize the
yard&#8211;stick, and, with another small stick for a bow,
endeavor to imitate what his uncle had played.
He heard it with his inward ear; but, for fear his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
parents were not so pervaded with the tune as he
was, he would explain as he went along, telling
how beautifully the bass came in at such and such
a place. Seeing the child play this rustic and
soundless fiddle, his uncle bought him, when he
was five years old, a violin &#8220;as yellow as a lemon.&#8221;
He used to tell, later, how he felt carried up to
the third heaven when his own little hand first
brought out a tune from that yellow violin. He
loved it and kissed it; it seemed to him so beautiful,
that little fiddle! To the surprise of the
family, he played well on it from the first, though
he had received no instruction. He would stand
by his mother&#8217;s knee while she turned the screws,
which would not yield to his little hand; and the
tuning was not easily accomplished, since his ear
made him very critical even at that age. His
uncle taught him his notes at the same time that
he was learning his primer.</p>

<p>His father would not permit him to play till
study hours were over, and he could not practice
regularly, but made the violin rather his recreation.
Sometimes, however, he disobeyed, playing
too much and missing his lessons, for which his
back had to smart both in school and at home.
It was a paternal rule that a whipping at school
had to be repeated at home. Still he managed to
get through his elementary studies, and when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
reached the higher branches of knowledge he
surprised everybody by his remarkable quickness
and penetration. In mythology he had no peer
in the school, and his imaginative, dreamy soul
reveled in all the weird stories about Odin, Thor,
Balder, Frey, and the whole race of gods, giants,
norns, elves, and dwarfs that fill the old Valhalla
of the Norsemen. He was never happier than
when he could persuade his grandmothers to tell
him strange ghost stories, and sing the wild songs
of the peasantry. The creative and imaginative
cast of his mind also gave him a profound sympathy
with nature, and he was fortunate in having
a home in the midst of grand scenery.</p>

<p>Prof. R. B. Anderson thus writes of Ole&#8217;s boyhood:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I once asked Ole Bull what had inspired his weird
and original melodies. His answer was that from his
earliest childhood he had taken the profoundest delight
in Norway&#8217;s natural scenery. He grew eloquent in his
poetic description of the grand and picturesque flower&#8211;clad
valleys, filled with soughing groves and singing
birds; of the silver&#8211;crested mountains, from which the
summer sun never departs; of the melodious brooks,
babbling streams, and thundering rivers; of the blinking
lakes that sink their deep thoughts to starlit skies;
of the far&#8211;penetrating <i>fjords</i> and the many thousand
islands on the coast. He spoke with especial emphasis
of the eagerness with which he had devoured all myths,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
folk&#8211;tales, ballads, and popular melodies; and all these
things, he said, &#8220;have made my music.&#8221; And we would
emphasize the fact that these things made his music,
not alone by their influence upon his mind, but also by
the impression they had made upon several generations
of his ancestors who had contemplated them. Ole
Bull&#8217;s ancestors have, on both sides, been people of culture
and refinement for many generations. When we
see a beautiful and thoughtful face, we do not always
consider how much the ancestors of that man or woman
must have suffered and labored and thought before that
beauty and intelligence became possible.</p></div>

<p>It happened that the hospitality of Ole&#8217;s father
was the means of bringing the boy his first teacher.
Herr Paulsen was a Dane, a good artist, a man of
solid musical acquirements and knowledge, who
could play the fiddle &#8220;as long as there was a drop
in the decanter before him.&#8221; He chanced to
meet Ole one day at the house of a more humble
colleague, with whom he would condescend to
take his schnapps, and began to visit the apothecary&#8217;s
house, &#8220;to educate the little artist,&#8221; as he
said. And he would sit and play till he <i>had</i>
drained the last drop from the decanter, which
the hospitality of the time could not deny him.
So thoroughly had he enjoyed the social, and we
may say convivial, life of Bergen&#8212;for the suppers
were often more than social at that time&#8212;that
he had delayed his return home from month to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
month, and stayed on indefinitely. When his
clothes grew threadbare, his friends would give
him a new suit and a benefit concert, from which
he often received some hundreds of dollars.</p>

<p>Ole&#8217;s parents were not pleased with the neglect
of his studies, caused by his fondness for the violin,
and their intention of entirely forbidding him
the instrument was hanging like a thunder&#8211;cloud
above his head, when, on his eighth birthday, he
gained a decisive victory.</p>

<p>One Tuesday evening Paulsen played, as usual,
the first violin in Uncle Jens&#8217;s quartette. But
when they left the supper&#8211;table he was hopelessly
<i>hors de combat</i>. In this unfortunate dilemma
good&#8211;natured Uncle Jens shouted, &#8220;Now, Ole,
you shall play in Paulsen&#8217;s stead! Come, my
boy, do your best, and you shall have a stick of
candy!&#8221; at the same time handing him Paulsen&#8217;s
violin. The half&#8211;serious, half&#8211;joking command
Ole accepted in earnest. A quartette of Pleyel,
which he had heard several times, was chosen,
and his memory served him faithfully; to the astonishment
of all, he played each movement correctly.
He not only executed the difficult passages,
but marked the rests,&#8212;in short, gave it as
an artist should.</p>

<p>This was his first triumph, with all its train of
consequences. His delighted uncle immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
had him elected an active member of the Tuesday
club, of whose performances he had before
been but a clandestine and often ingeniously hidden
listener; and, through his mother&#8217;s intercession,
it was arranged that Paulsen should give
him lessons regularly.</p>

<p>About this time a Frenchman arrived in Bergen
with violins for sale. One of them, bright
red in its color, gained the boy&#8217;s heart at first
sight, and he pleaded with his father till he consented
to buy it. It was purchased late in the
afternoon, and put away in its case. Ole slept
in a small bed in the same apartment with his
parents, and the much&#8211;coveted instrument was in
the adjoining room. Ole Bull, telling this incident
in later years, said,<a name="Anchor-1" id="Anchor-1"></a><a href="#Footnote-1" class="Anchor" title="Go to footnote 1.">[1]</a>&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I could not sleep for thinking of my new violin.
When I heard father and mother breathing deep, I rose
softly, and lighted a candle, and in my night&#8211;clothes did
go on tiptoe to open the case, and take one little peep.
The violin was so red, and the pretty pearl screws did
smile at me so! I pinched the strings just a little with
my fingers. It smiled at me ever more and more. I
took up the bow and looked at it. It said to me it
would be pleasant to try it across the strings. So I did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
try it, just a very, very little; and it did sing to me so
sweetly! Then I did creep farther away from the bedroom.
At first, I did play very soft. I make very,
very little noise. But presently I did begin a capriccio
which I like very much; and it do go ever louder and
louder; and I forgot that it was midnight and that
everybody was asleep. Presently, I hear something go
crack! and the next minute I feel my father&#8217;s whip
across my shoulders. My little red violin dropped on
the floor, and was broken. I weep much for it, but it
did no good. They did have a doctor to it next day,
but it never recovered its health.</p></div>

<p>The tears would always fill Ole Bull&#8217;s eyes
when he spoke of this great childish sorrow.</p>

<p>The violin with which he now practiced was
too large for him. When he placed it in the
usual position for playing, it hurt his neck and
fingers, and compelled him to hold his arm in the
way which from that time became a habit with
him. At ten years of age he could play passages
which his teacher found it impossible to perform;
but nothing would come to him by the mechanical
process. His genius positively refused to
go into the strait&#8211;jacket; and when father and
teacher coaxed and scolded, the nervous child at
last screamed with agony. This untamable freedom
was his strongest characteristic. At school
the confinement of four walls would sometimes
become so oppressive that he would suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
spring out of the window into God&#8217;s sunshine
and air. His father often gave him permission to
go to the woods of a holiday, and not seldom released
him from the Sunday morning service,
which was very tedious in the cold, dreary church
with its close air, and where he must listen to the
singing of the congregation so dreadfully out of
tune to his ears. He realized in later years how
his father must have sympathized with him in relaxing,
as he did, the discipline which was much
more strict then than nowadays. An indication
that his father was yielding to a recognition of
his son&#8217;s determination to study music, was the
fact that, on his ninth birthday, he presented
him Fiorillo&#8217;s &#8220;Studies,&#8221; which he had ordered
from Copenhagen. During that year Waldemar
Thrane, the violinist, visited Bergen, and Ole
played one of the Studies for him.</p>

<p>We have heard from his own lips and from
others that he was very fond of composing original
melodies, and in these he took especial pains
to imitate the voices of nature; the wind in the
trees, the rustle of the leaves, the call of birds, the
babble of brooks, the roar of waterfalls, and the
weird sounds heard among his native mountains.</p>

<p>As a boy he became passionately fond of
Lysekloster, a large estate to the south of Bergen,
which he visited with his father when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
was eight years old. His brothers relate how his
glowing descriptions would tempt them to start
out with him to take the twenty&#8211;mile walk from
Bergen to Lysekloster, and how, one after another,
they would fall behind, while he would run
the whole distance with but one or two stops.
Lysekloster is, indeed, one of the most charming
spots in all Norway, and to Ole Bull was &#8220;the
loveliest on earth.&#8221; In its noble forests and
streams, its broad outlook upon sea and <i>fjords</i>
with their many islands, upon mountains and
glaciers glittering in the distance, will be found
Ole Bull&#8217;s weird music transformed into landscape.
Lysekloster was the chief delight of his
boyhood, his manhood, and his age. A rock,
which he climbed when a boy to get a splendid
view, is still pointed out by the peasants, who
called it at that early day &#8220;Ole Bull&#8217;s Lookout.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ole was exceedingly fond of beautiful cocks,
and when eight or nine years old, after he had
played in public, while walking home carrying his
violin in a gingham bag, he discovered one of the
finest specimens he had ever seen, and was so
fascinated and bewitched that in watching it he
forgot himself, stumbled, and fell into the muddy
gutter. But a kind lady had watched the boy
with amusement from her window, and came to
his rescue. She took him into her house, washed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and dried the bag, gave him apples, and sent him
home happy, telling him not to let the cock lead
him astray again. He adopted later for his crest
a cock with the motto, &#8220;<span lang="la">Bellum vita, vita bellum.</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Ole and his six brothers used to select sea&#8211;shells
of different tones to blow upon, and under
his direction they practiced until they produced
some very musical and pleasant effects. At other
times he and his brothers Jens and Randulf
would improvise songs with accompaniments, taking
turns in improvising and accompanying.</p>

<p>The mother took great pains in training her
children in manners. They had to go out, rap at
the door, and enter the room again and again
until they acquired the desired bearing, and this
exercise was often repeated. After they were
grown up, one of the brothers was about to pay
a visit to some friends in town one evening. He
had said his &#8220;<span lang="no">Farvel</span>&#8221; and gone through the form
of leave&#8211;taking, but on reaching the hall, he remembered
that he had left something in the sitting&#8211;room.
With his hat on his head he rushed
back to get what he had forgotten; but his
mother, who observed him, quietly crossed the
room and gave him a box on the ear, saying:
&#8220;That is the way he must be treated who has
forgotten to show due respect to his mother!&#8221;</p>

<p>The family spent their summers at Valestrand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
a country house about twenty miles east of Bergen,
which had long been in the possession of the
Bull family. The children always looked eagerly
forward to the sojourn there, and there Ole was
always very happy. He would seek out the most
solitary places, where he could sit and play undisturbed.
Occasional solitude was already in
his childhood a necessity; so many thoughts and
melodies crowded in upon him that he felt a
desire to run away from everybody and wander
off into the world of fancy, where no human being
could disturb his quiet dreams. Soon alarming
rumors about ghosts, hobgoblins, trolls, and
other supernatural beings went abroad at Valestrand.
It was whispered among the peasants
that fiddle strains had been heard at most unseasonable
hours from the very mountains. The
<i>Hulder</i> had come back to take possession of
them again. Old half&#8211;forgotten stories and traditions
were revived and circulated; it was considered
no longer safe to go abroad alone. But
one of the men ventured at last to investigate the
matter more closely. He cautiously approached
the place whence the tones proceeded; trembling
with fear he came nearer and nearer, and there,
way down in the bottom of a &#8220;giant&#8217;s cauldron,&#8221;
of which there are many at Valestrand, sat the
goblin perfectly concealed playing the weirdest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
marches and dances on a little violin. The secret
was out. There was the little Ole, utterly unconscious
of all the excitement and terror he had
caused in the neighborhood, and merely provoked
that anybody should have discovered his
secret chamber so well hidden by the bushes.</p>

<p>At Valestrand he was free, and the impressions
he received were very vivid. The atmosphere
was filled with music, and in music all he felt or
experienced had to be expressed. If he could
not make his instrument utter his thoughts to
suit him, he would, after patient trials, at last
fling it away and be angry with it for many days.
He would not even look at it. Then he would
perhaps suddenly get up in the middle of the
night, seat himself at the open window in his
night&#8211;dress, and play the strangest airs and melodies.
He was frequently scolded for disturbing
the peace of the night, but seemed not to hear
when he was in this mood. At other times he
would play almost incessantly for days together,
hardly eating or sleeping in the mean time.</p>

<p>He was a mere boy when he began to study
the nature and construction of the violin. Frequently
he would take it all to pieces when he
was dissatisfied with it, put each part by itself,
dry them in the sun, and then put them together
again, more or less pleased with the result.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>No place could have been better fitted than
Valestrand to give a healthful impulse and development
to the lads, who scaled the cliffs and
mountains, swam the lakes, and sailed their boats
on the <i>fjords</i>. They used to pride themselves
on living out&#8211;of&#8211;doors as woodsmen, and would
have liked to sleep as well as eat in the woods.
Ole led his younger brothers in all their games
and sports, except fishing and shooting. He always
had an aversion to these pursuits, which
could not yield him pleasure enough to compensate
for the pain inflicted; and he never overcame
this feeling.</p>

<p>With all their activity it was remarkable, the
brothers have since said, that they escaped whole&#8211;limbed,
and sometimes with their lives. When
grandmother was questioned once by a friend as
to how she could rest when the boys were with
her at Valestrand, she answered: &#8220;Why, my dear,
if we sent nurses after each one, what would their
guardian angels have to do?&#8221; So for their summer
vacation they were given their freedom. The
sisters were, of course, kept more at home, but
they, too, had a good time in the hay&#8211;field, and
joined in some of their brothers&#8217; frolics.</p>

<p>The death of a baby sister made a deep impression
on Ole, and he told, in one of the last years
of his life, how he had stolen into the room where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the little one lay so still, but so beautiful, and
alone kept watch while his heart seemed breaking.
When he grieved he could seldom speak
of his sorrow, and he passed through that experience
alone, none of the family knowing then, or
later, of the watch he had kept with the dead
child.</p>

<p>At the age of nine years Ole played the first
violin in the orchestra, when his father acted at
the theatre; and it may be added that his father
was one of the best amateur actors in Bergen,
and knew all Holberg&#8217;s and Wessel&#8217;s dramas by
heart.</p>

<p>From 1819 to 1822 Ole received no musical instruction
whatever. He had outgrown his former
teacher, Paulsen, who, to the astonishment of his
friends, suddenly left Bergen. Mr. Goldschmidt
says: &#8220;This act of his was variously interpreted;
I prefer to explain it by an allusion to an old
Danish tale of the elf king, who must vanish when
a real king enters his dominions.&#8221;</p>

<p>In 1822 a Swedish violinist, Lundholm by
name and a pupil of Baillot, settled in Bergen.
From him Ole now received instruction; but a
coldness soon sprang up between pupil and
teacher. The latter was very strict, and insisted
that no deviations from established rules should
be permitted. He made the lad stand erect with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
his head and back against the wall while playing,
and this, no doubt, gave him that repose and
grace of bearing so noticeable in later years. But
fortunately Mr. Lundholm did not succeed in
making Ole hold his violin according to the accepted
rule, as the boy would go almost frantic
at times when this was attempted; and this independence
of study and method developed later
into an interesting episode, to be related after a
slight digression.</p>

<p>One of his father&#8217;s assistants played the flute,
and used to receive musical catalogues from Copenhagen.
Ole devoured the names, and for the
first time saw that of Paganini in connection with
his famous twenty&#8211;four &#8220;Caprices.&#8221; One evening
his father brought home two Italians, the first
Ole had ever seen. He was then fourteen years
of age, and their talk was a new revelation to him.
They told him all they knew of Paganini, the
very mention of whose name excited him. He
afterwards related the story to a friend thus:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I went to my sympathizer and said: &#8220;Dear grandmother,
can&#8217;t I have some of Paganini&#8217;s music?&#8221;
&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell any one,&#8221; said the dear old woman, &#8220;but I
will try to buy a piece of his for you if you are a good
child;&#8221; and she did try, and I was wild when I at last
had the Paganini music. How difficult it was, but oh,
how beautiful! The garden&#8211;house was more than ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
my refuge, and perhaps the cats, who were still my only
listeners, were not so frightened at my attempts as at
my earlier efforts to play Fiorillo&#8217;s &#8220;Studies,&#8221; when I
really drove them from their food.</p>

<p>On a Tuesday quartette evening, Herr Lundholm
played Baillot&#8217;s &#8220;Caprizzi,&#8221; and I was greatly disappointed
at the pedantic, phlegmatic manner in which
he rendered the passionate passages. A concerto of
Spohr&#8217;s lay on the leader&#8217;s stand, and while the company
were at supper I tried the score. Carried away
with the music, I forgot myself, and was discovered by
Lundholm on his return, and scolded for my presumption.</p>

<p>&#8220;What impudence! Perhaps you think you could
play this at sight, boy!&#8221; &#8220;Yes, I think I could.&#8221;
And as I thought so, I don&#8217;t know why I should not
have said so&#8212;do you? The rest of the company had
now joined us, and insisted that I should try it. I
played the allegro. All applauded save the leader, who
looked angry. &#8220;You think you can play anything,
then?&#8221; he asked, and taking a caprice of Paganini&#8217;s
from the stand, he said: &#8220;Try this.&#8221; Now it happened
that this very caprice was my favorite, as the cats well
knew. I could play it by heart, and I polished it off.
When I had finished they all shouted, and, instead of
raving, as I thought he would, Lundholm was more
polite and kind than he had ever been before, and told
me that with practice I might hope to equal himself
some day.</p></div>

<p>About this time Ole&#8217;s fiddle brought him his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
first gift. There lived an old man on the outskirts
of the city who passed his life in solitude,
occupying a house with a small garden around it.
Ole had heard many stories of his miserly and
eccentric ways, and magnified them till he felt a
fear of him. When he took his walks in the
country, he would always run as fast as he could
past this lonely house, and he never breathed
freely till he was well beyond the garden fence.
One day the old man stood at the gate and called
to Ole. The boy trembled, but his training made
him instinctively greet the stranger with respect,
though he would fain have taken to his heels.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you the son of Johan Bull? Are you
the boy that plays the fiddle?&#8221; &#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
&#8220;Then come with me,&#8221; he said, as he turned and
walked up the path to the door. Ole hesitated,
but when his companion added, as he looked back
and observed that Ole was still at the gate, &#8220;I
have a fiddle I bought in England that I want to
show you,&#8221; the boy bounded up the walk; and he
soon found that the old man had a kind face,
now that he dared to look at him.</p>

<p>The fiddle proved to be in need of bridge and
sounding&#8211;post, but the boy was happy enough
when told that he might whittle out the missing
parts. After adjusting these as well as he could
and tuning the strings, he tried the old bow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
which was much the worse for wear and neglect.
His new friend sat by interested, and kept time
with his head and foot while Ole played the folk
dances and songs. Then he asked the boy if he
had ever heard &#8220;God save the King.&#8221; &#8220;Yes, I
can play it for you if you like,&#8221; said Ole, who
soon perceived by the old man&#8217;s brightening face
and interested nods that he had hit upon his
favorite tune. Many times he had to repeat it,
and finally, when he improvised two or three
variations on the air, his delighted listener made
him promise that whenever he passed the house
he would come in and play that tune for him.
Ole was treated to cakes and milk, and felt himself
a distinguished guest.</p>

<p>The following afternoon towards dusk the
door&#8211;bell rang and a basket was found in the hall.
On opening the basket Ole&#8217;s mother discovered
four pair of doves, all rare and very beautiful.
A card attached to a blue ribbon round the neck
of one bore Ole&#8217;s name. The delighted boy recognized
at once the choicest birds of the cote
which his friend had shown him the day before,
and he told his parents all about his visit. He
did not forget his promise, but often went and
played &#8220;God save the King&#8221; for the old man.</p>

<p>Ole&#8217;s father wished him to become a clergyman,
and thinking that the boy would do better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
in his studies with a private tutor, who could
have an eye to him constantly, engaged a Mr.
Musæus (known later as the rector Musæus).
This man, it is said, had great abilities, but afterwards,
when appointed master of a public school,
brought disgrace upon himself by his cruelty.
At the slightest offense given by a boy he would
summon the school together and, after offering a
fervid prayer that the punishment he was about
to inflict might benefit the culprit, he would fall
on him like a savage. This tutor, declaring
Ole&#8217;s musical tastes incompatible with his studies,
forbade him to play the violin; and thus the boy
could only indulge at night in an inclination that
now, under this restraint, became a passion.</p>

<p>The boys had long and patiently borne both
cross words and blows from Musæus, but at last
they ceased to consider patience a virtue. A
council of war was held, and they solemnly resolved
that when occasion offered they would
teach the tyrant a lesson. But this required
courage. Ole had developed into an athletic
fellow, even more robust than his brothers, and
they naturally looked to him as leader in the bold
enterprise.</p>

<p>One morning when at half past four their tormentor
appeared and dragged out the youngest
from his warm bed, Ole sprang upon him with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
growl. A violent struggle followed, but Musæus
was no match for the lithe and powerful lad.
The younger brothers, who had promised to assist,
uncovered their heads now and then to cry,
&#8220;Don&#8217;t give up, Ole! Don&#8217;t give up! Give it to
him with all your might!&#8221; In the midst of this
excitement the maid came up to make the fire,
and with the tongs in one hand and shovel of
coals in the other she stood rooted to the spot
with astonishment, though at the same time she
was evidently not displeased at the schoolmaster&#8217;s
plight. A moment later the mother came running
up the stairs in her green wrapper and with
nightcap on her head. She supposed the house
had caught fire. But Ole neither heard nor saw
anybody, till Musæus, all out of breath, collapsed
on the floor and gave up beaten. &#8220;That will do
now,&#8221; said the father, who had just appeared on
the scene. Ole expected a storm, but felt a sense
of relief when he saw his parents exchange an
amused look as they left the room. From that
day he felt that he could go to his father with
any real grievance, and be listened to. He was
more consulted, too, as to his inclination for certain
studies and work. All this made him very
happy and more desirous than ever of carrying
out his father&#8217;s wishes.</p>

<p>After having spent three years in study with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the private tutor, Ole Bull was sent in August,
1828, to the University in Christiania. His fame
preceded him. His originality and the independent
control he had gained over his instrument
had secured for him a position far above that of
the amateur, and his reputation as a remarkable
player may be said to have been pretty well established
at the capital before he came there to
take his <i>Examen Artium</i>.</p>

<p>When restrained by his tutor from playing, Ole
resorted to whistling and singing, and he soon
found that he could do both at the same time.
In this way he studied the laws of harmony. Ere
long he was able to whistle and sing and accompany
himself on two strings, and later he succeeded
in playing on all four strings at once.
These studies enabled him at length to combine
six different themes at the same time, a sort of
fugue study which he always enjoyed.</p>

<p>His father, aware of his passion for music, earnestly
entreated him not to yield to it, and Ole&#8217;s
way to Christiania was paved with the best intentions
to obey. But on arriving there he was met
by friends&#8212;students from Bergen&#8212;who invited
him to play at a concert to be given that very
night, for a charitable purpose. &#8220;But,&#8221; said Ole,
&#8220;my father has forbidden me to play.&#8221; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>&#8220;Would
your father prevent your doing an act of charity?&#8221;
&#8220;Well, this alters the case a little; and I can
write to him and claim his pardon.&#8221;</p>

<p>The performers at this concert were all <i>dilettanti</i>,
and two of them became later ministers of
state. The next evening a young professor of
the University had a quartette at his home, and
Ole, on being pressed to take a part, thought,
&#8220;Well, my father himself would no doubt wish me
to be on a good footing with one of the professors;&#8221;
and he went. They played all night, until
seven o&#8217;clock in the morning, and at nine o&#8217;clock
Ole was to go up for his written examination.
Scarcely able to keep his eyes open, he wrote a
Latin exercise that could not pass, and according
to the severe rules of the University, he was
<i>rejected</i> for the year. In the deepest despair he
went to his host the professor, who laughingly
said: &#8220;My good fellow, this is the very best
thing that could have happened to you! Do you
believe yourself fitted for a curacy in Finmark or
a mission among the Laps? certainly not! It
is the opinion of your friends that you should
travel abroad: meanwhile, old Thrane having been
taken ill, you are appointed <i>ad interim</i> musical
director of the Philharmonic and Dramatic Societies.&#8221;
A month later, on the death of Thrane,
Ole Bull was regularly installed in these offices,
and thus at once attained independence, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
gained a somewhat reluctant pardon from his
father.</p>

<p>Henrik Wergeland writes:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It was at this time I first became acquainted with
him; a tall, somewhat overgrown, sickly&#8211;looking youth,
with a splendidly developed bust, but with a nervous
irritability of temperament; his open face was very
pale, and the large, clear eyes were set deeply under the
brow. He liked to talk of what he was going to write,
and he actually did compose some bits, mere bagatelles,
puffs of smoke, with a few glittering gleams from that
fire which flamed behind the clouds. His ideas were as
yet crude, but there was creative imagination in them.
His plans were as yet forced, but they ran out into picturesque
and grandly romantic effects. His state of
mind was still chaotic, but it was that kind of chaos
from which Schiller sent forth &#8220;The Robbers;&#8221; that
kind of chaos which forebodes a brilliant revelation. He
also liked to talk of politics and literature; but he was
not always mindful of the talent most persons have for
catching the words and dropping the thought. When
gainsaid he might become provoked, not from egotism,
or pride, or sensitiveness, but simply from the exaltation
of his mood and the excitement of the moment.</p>

<p>There was that froth in him which belongs to all good
and strong wine, and when others cautiously retired a
step or two, I was tempted to throw myself on his neck,
for I felt that he was a most modest, unpretentious
man, childlike, trusting, and true. As yet, no memory
of achieved triumphs had thrown its glare or its shadow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
about him; he stood there in the pure light of his great
and noble hope. He was not, however, at rest in Christiania.
His mind was in a state of restless agitation.
He was like a balloon straining and tugging to get loose
from its moorings and rise into the upper air. At last
he determined to go to Cassel, to Louis Spohr. He
wanted the verdict of a real master; he wanted the consecration
of the true high&#8211;priest; and May 18, 1829, he
hurried off for the land of promise. But he left behind
his violin, and his friends had to send it after him. This
may perhaps be explained by the fact that he left Norway
when the excitement was at its height concerning
the interdiction of the observance of Independence Day,
the 17th of May, in which he had taken part.</p></div>

<p>This seems to be the best point at which to
introduce a short sketch of Norwegian history,
enough to show the relation which Ole Bull bore
to his country and her men in his youth and manhood.</p>

<p>Norway had for four hundred and thirty&#8211;eight
years, from 1376 to 1814, been united to Denmark;
but the example of America and France
in the second half of the 18th century had awakened
the spirit of independence. During the war
between England and Denmark, all communication
between Norway and the latter country had
been cut off, and the Norsemen were learning to
rely on themselves.</p>

<p>The Swedes had, during the time of this union,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
made repeated attempts to conquer Norway, but
without success. When, in 1809, they were compelled
to cede Finland to Russia, they again
turned to Norway, with a stronger determination
than ever for the conquest of that country. This
would indemnify them for the loss of Finland,
and circumstances seemed to favor their ambition.
The old king, Charles XIII., was a mere
shadow of power, and the Swedes had chosen
Bernadotte, the successful French general, to be
the successor of their childless sovereign. England
favored the designs of Sweden.</p>

<p>In 1813, Napoleon was beaten by his united opponents,
and Karl Johan (Bernadotte) marched
with a united Swedish and Russian army against
Denmark, to invade Holstein. The Danes fought
bravely, but were obliged to surrender. On the
14th of January, 1814, the union between Denmark
and Norway was dissolved. The treaty of
Kiel, signed on that day, provided that Sweden
should have Norway, and in return should assume
the payment of a part of the debt of Norway
and Denmark. Norway&#8217;s old tributaries,
Iceland, the Faroes, and Greenland, were to remain
subject to Denmark. In accordance with
this treaty, King Frederic VI. issued a proclamation
to the Norwegians, and released them from
the oath of fealty to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>The Norwegians would not submit to this bargain
and sale. There was but one sentiment
among the people&#8212;the defense of their independence.
All Europe was against them, and
they were poor and few in numbers; still they
dared to make resistance.</p>

<p>In 1814, the Danish Crown Prince, Christian
Frederic, had been appointed governor of Norway.
He went to Drontheim, intending to have
himself proclaimed monarch, by virtue of his inherited
right, but he found the sentiment in favor
of a free constitution, and some were in favor of
proclaiming a republic. Those who did not recognize
his claims had already made a draft of
a constitution. This was the celebrated Adler&#8211;Falsen
constitution, from which many important
paragraphs were embodied in the present Norse
constitution. At Eidsvold, thirty miles north of
Christiania, several of Norway&#8217;s most prominent
men had assembled on the 10th of February to
discuss the fate of their country. One of their
number, Sverdrup, uncle of the present president
of the Storthing, succeeded in convincing the
Prince and making him acknowledge that the
people had the right to frame their own constitution.
Meanwhile, Prince Christian was to govern
the country with the title of Prince Regent. A
convention of delegates elected by the people was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
to be called at Eidsvold, for the purpose of preparing
the constitution. In a letter dated the 19th
of February, 1814, Christian Frederic agreed to
this.</p>

<p>A day of fasting and prayer was appointed.
The people were instructed in regard to the state
of the country in their churches, and they were
sworn to defend with their lives and blood the independence
of their fatherland. Two men were
to be chosen in each parish as delegates to the
national convention. All this was carried out.</p>

<p>On the 17th of May, 1814, the constitution was
adopted by the convention. It provided that the
people should make the laws through their
chosen representatives; that the people alone
could impose taxes; that the press should be free,
and that no hereditary rights should be acknowledged.
Prince Christian Frederic was chosen
King of Norway.</p>

<p>Karl Johan of Sweden, with thirty thousand
men sent him from Russia in recognition of his
services against Napoleon, and with the promised
help of England, Prussia, and Austria, invaded
Norway. Utterly abandoned, opposed by all the
powers of Europe, the famished, poverty&#8211;stricken
country had only its just cause to depend upon
for its success. Delegates from Austria, Russia,
Prussia, and England arrived in Christiania, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
all expressed the desire of their respective governments
that Norway should be united with Sweden.
This was refused. War was proclaimed on the
30th of June.</p>

<p>A few unimportant battles were fought, and
the advantage was on the side of the Norwegians
with their small force of twenty thousand men,
which could not be increased on account of the
scarcity of food.</p>

<p>Karl Johan knew that Sweden was as much in
need of peace as Norway; that the union was
doubtful; that he would not be able to conquer
Norway without help from his allies, who had
not yet sent their forces. Should he delay, the
monarchs might prefer to put a prince of the true
Oldenburg blood on the throne of Norway, and
his own position might be weakened by the re&#8211;instatement
of the old monarchical families after
the fall of Napoleon. He determined on a <i>coup
d&#8217;état</i>. After a two weeks&#8217; war he abandoned his
claims under the treaty of Kiel and acknowledged
Norway&#8217;s right to determine her own future. He
suddenly proposed a treaty on the basis of her independence,
and agreed to accept the constitution
recently adopted at Eidsvold. In the course of a
few months a parliament met, accepted the resignation
of Christian Frederic, adopted the constitution
of Eidsvold, organized the government,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and elected Karl Johan king on November 4,
1814.</p>

<p>Norway was thus united to Sweden, and had
secured for herself one of the most liberal constitutions
in Europe; and the fruit of it was a new
life in her industries, her literature, and her art.</p>

<p>With Iceland, Norway had enjoyed a golden
literary epoch from the 11th to the middle of the
14th century. It was the epoch of the Eddas
and Sagas. During the four centuries of union
with Denmark the country had been more or less
shrouded in intellectual darkness. The people
preserved their ballads, their popular melodies,
their folk&#8211;lore and legends, but the literary record
of the period shows only here and there a name
of any note.</p>

<p>In the 18th century, Norway produced several
distinguished poets, among whom should be mentioned
Holberg, the father of modern Danish
literature, who was born in Bergen in 1684;
Wessel, Vihe, J. N. Brun, Monrad, Fasting, the
brothers Frimann, Zatlitz, Rein, and Edvard
Storm. Ole Bull was related to Holberg and
Storm. The distinguished naval officer Tordenskjöld
was a Norwegian. Many of these men
were members of a Norse Society organized at
the Copenhagen University, and they, with their
love for Norway and faith in her people, may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
said to have laid the foundations of her independence.
Some of them lived to see this independence
accomplished.</p>

<p>With 1814 began a new epoch in the liberty
of the country. It was soon demonstrated that
the national spirit was not dead. Men appeared
who were able to build up the literature, arts, and
sciences of the country, and later Ole Bull led the
van among the artists, and inspired those who
came after him with courage. He convinced not
only the outside world, but the Norsemen themselves,
that they could foster sons worthy of their
old renown.</p>

<p>The indirect influence of Ole Bull&#8217;s success
upon the art and literature of Norway was very
great. The ambition of many a youth was kindled
by him, who afterward became widely known
as musician, painter, sculptor, or poet.</p>

<p>In 1828, Ole Bull became acquainted with two
young men in Christiania who were destined to
wield a mighty influence on Norse literature and
politics. The one was Johan S. C. Welhaven,
born in Bergen in 1807, the other Henrik Arnold
Wergeland, born in Christiansand in 1808. Both
became very eminent poets, and about 1832 both
were leaders of contending parties. Wergeland
gave the first poetical expression to the glowing
patriotic enthusiasm for liberty and independence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
He desired to root out every vestige of
Danish influence. Welhaven was the leader of
the conservatives, and aimed to build the Norse
culture on the basis of the Danish. The discussion,
at first limited to the students of the University,
soon became a national issue in which
every thoughtful man and woman in the land
took part.</p>

<p>Wergeland died at the age of thirty&#8211;six, but he
lived long enough to see his cause victorious, and
the fruits of his labors are felt to&#8211;day.</p>

<p>In the celebration of Independence Day commemorative
of the Norse constitution, Wergeland
saw a powerful means of waking the people from
their political sleep to a patriotic fervor. He used
all his influence to promote the celebration of
this day, which was as unpopular as possible with
the king. The latter had more than once attempted
to bring about changes in the constitution,
but the people had been true to it, refusing
to amend it even at royal request.</p>

<p>On the 17th of May, 1829, a peaceful gathering
of people in the Christiania market&#8211;place
was attacked and dispersed by a troop of cavalry.
Ole Bull was with Wergeland, who was severely
wounded by one of the soldiers. This roused the
people to preserve and defend their rights. The
17th of May has been celebrated with increasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
enthusiasm ever since, and Wergeland&#8217;s name is
never omitted from the orations of the day.</p>

<p>The day following the battle of the market&#8211;place
and the first celebration of the 17th of May,
Ole Bull, as we have said, left for Cassel to visit
Spohr. His reception there was a cold one. &#8220;I
have come more than five hundred miles to hear
you,&#8221; Ole Bull said, politely, to which Spohr replied:
&#8220;Very well, you can now go to Nordhausen;
I am to attend a musical festival there.&#8221; To
Nordhausen he accordingly went, where he heard
a quartette by Maurer, performed by the composer
himself, Spohr, Wiele, and the eldest of the
brothers Müller. He was so overwhelmed with
disappointment at the manner in which the composition
was played by these four masters&#8212;a
manner which differed so utterly from his own
conception&#8212;that he left the concert with the
crushing conviction that he was deceived in his
aspirations, and had no true calling for music.
He determined at once to give up art and to return
to his academic studies.</p>

<p>Falling in with some lively Göttingen students,
returning from a trip in the Hartz Mountains, he
joined them and went to Göttingen. He stayed
there some months, and a merry life his violin
called forth. The burgomaster of the neighboring
town, Münden, heard of the foreign student<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
who played so marvelously well, and asked a
friend to bring him with some other musical acquaintances
to Münden, to give a concert for the
poor. One fine summer morning, accordingly,
eight young fellows set out for Münden, four playing
in one carriage, four singing in another. In
grand state the two carriages drew up before the
door of the burgomaster, who in full dress received
his guests, and immediately led them to
the dinner&#8211;table. Ole Bull anxiously observed
during the feast how one after another of his assistants
dropped off into dreamland. He remonstrated,
but was only laughed at; he was in despair,
and at last angry. The toasts still kept up:
&#8220;Long life to the burgomaster&#8212;his wife&#8212;his
daughter&#8212;the good city of Münden,&#8221; etc., and
when, at length, they rose from the board, with
shaky knees and dizzy heads, the violinist knew
not what to do. No rehearsal was held, and none
was possible. The last piece on the programme
was to be an improvisation, &#8220;The Storm,&#8221; in
which the student Ziedler was to give the thunder
on the piano in accompaniment to the violin; but
he was fast losing himself. Ole Bull expostulated
with him, and tried to rouse him, but in vain. At
last, losing his temper in his despair, he called
him <i lang="de">Dummer junge</i> (stupid fellow). This, as the
reader familiar with the customs of the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
students knows, is an offense that blood alone
can redress. Ole Bull accepted the challenge
which followed, practiced fencing for a week,
acted on the suggestion of tiring out his adversary
by dexterous parrying, and gave him at last
a slight scratch. Then came a grand scene of
reconciliation, and eternal friendship was sworn;
but the director of the police gave the party a
friendly hint to leave the town.<a name="Anchor-2" id="Anchor-2"></a><a href="#Footnote-2" class="Anchor" title="Go to footnote 2.">[2]</a></p>

<p>September found Ole Bull again in Norway;
and a friend wrote thus of his return:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Feeling as if the very soil of Europe had repelled
him, he returned to Christiania. It was a wet autumn
evening, and he went to the theatre, the musical direction
of which he had given up. While standing there in
a dark corner, he was soon recognized, and it was whispered
through the house, &#8220;Ole Bull has returned;&#8221;
then, the whisper rising into a loud cry, the violinist was
called to the direction of the orchestra; and on his taking
the bâton the audience called for the national anthem,
thus welcoming him as with the heart of the nation.</p></div>

<p>To go to Paris, to hear De Beriot, Baillot, and
Berlioz, now became his absorbing plan. In the
summer of 1830 he visited Trondhjem and Bergen,
and gave three concerts, from which he made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
five hundred dollars. In August, 1831, he went
by sea to Ostend, and thence directly to Paris.
Seven years passed before he saw Norway again,
but good reports soon came from him, and these
grew in number and frequency. When he finally
came himself, his reputation was made.</p>

<p>His stay in Paris was a venture which brought
him many hardships, but which ended like a fairy&#8211;tale
in a piece of good fortune. His recommendations
from home opened no serviceable doors
to him, and to his violin no one seemed willing to
listen. A passer&#8211;by might stop for a moment and
ask, &#8220;Who lives here? He plays well.&#8221; A grisette
might open her window across the street,
and look at &#8220;<span lang="fr">le pauvre jeune homme la</span>.&#8221; A melancholy
acquaintance among the German musicians
might sit down before him in unavailing admiration.
But no lessons from Baillot, no engagement
at the Grand Opéra, and every day the
purse growing leaner and leaner. The cholera
was raging terribly in Paris during that winter of
1831. The Revolution of the previous July was
still a vivid memory, and under the feverish excitement
of danger and death the pulse of life beat
with double rapidity in the great city. Madame
Malibran was singing at the Opéra, and the house
was crowded nightly by the enthusiastic Parisians.
In the topmost gallery, in one of the cheapest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
seats, might be seen a tall young man with feverish
eyes, drinking in those tones with his whole
soul.</p>

<p>He had still sufficient means to carry him
through the winter; but an elderly gentleman
who lived in the same house, and who, with a
shrewd mingling of cordiality and dignity, played
the part of a fatherly friend, contrived to win his
confidence, and persuaded him that, in the disturbed
state of financial affairs, his money was
not safe where he had deposited it. He therefore
drew it from the bank. The following morning
found him robbed of everything but an old suit
of clothes, and his paternal friend gone. He was
now reduced to extreme want; but an acquaintance,
accidentally meeting him, recommended
him to Madame Charon, with whom he himself
boarded, and who kept a house patronized chiefly
by German music teachers and scholars. She
offered to receive Ole Bull until he could hear
from home, his friend giving security for sixty
francs a month, which provided the young man
with black bread for breakfast, and, towards evening,
with a dinner of two slices of meat, the first
course of soup being much like that which made
the sailor boy exclaim, &#8220;This is very good; I have
found one pea!&#8221;</p>

<p>As time went on Madame began to look suspicious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and his friend&#8217;s manner grew cold. One
morning at breakfast, a stranger appeared, who
at once attracted his attention. He had black,
rough hair, his complexion was olive, his eyes
black, large, and penetrating. His expression was
cynical, but refined; his conversation cold and
ironical; his figure thin and wasted; in short, he
looked quite a Mephistopheles. He made a bad
impression on young Bull. When told by his
friend that the man was a detective, he said that
he had suspected as much, which was overheard,
and at first made the stranger very angry, but
when Ole replied in a calm, manly way his bearing
suddenly changed to one of kindly interest in
the violinist. &#8220;May I trouble you a moment,
sir?&#8221; Mephistopheles said; &#8220;I have something to
tell you. Not far from here, in the Rue Vaugirard,
is an <i lang="fr">estaminet</i> where we shall be undisturbed;&#8221;
and thither they went. It was one of
those public houses where the lamp is kept burning
all day, and young men, who look as if they
had not slept at night, move round the billiard&#8211;tables
in their shirt&#8211;sleeves, pipes in their mouths,
and glasses filled with <i lang="fr">eau de vie</i> on the window&#8211;seats
and the chimney&#8211;pieces.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; said the stranger. &#8220;I know you are
in want; but follow my advice; you must try
your luck at play.&#8221; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>&#8220;But I have no money.&#8221;
&#8220;You must manage to get five francs; then go
to&#8211;night, between ten and eleven o&#8217;clock, not earlier,
to Frascati&#8217;s, in the Boulevard Montmartre.
Mount the stairs, ring the bell, and give your hat
boldly to the liveried servant in attendance; enter
the hall, go straight to the table, put your
five francs on the red, and let it remain there.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man ran home, raised the five
francs, and was on the spot at the appointed hour.
He made his way to the green table, surrounded
by ladies and gentlemen playing at <i lang="fr">trente et quarante</i>.
He placed his five francs on the red, but
through his awkwardness it rolled over to the
black, and was lost. He stood as if struck by
lightning, without a <i>sous</i> in his pocket. He came
to himself on hearing, &#8220;<span lang="fr">Messieurs, faites vos jeux</span>.&#8221;
He called, &#8220;<span lang="fr">Cinq francs</span>,&#8221; but his foreign accent
made it sound like &#8220;<span lang="fr">Cent francs</span>,&#8221; and one hundred
francs were shoved over to him as his winnings.
He stands pale for a moment, unable to
speak or move; then places his money on the red,
and wins once, again, and yet again, until, at last,
eight hundred francs in gold lie in a heap before
him. &#8220;I was in a fever,&#8221; he said, when relating
the adventure later; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>&#8220;I acted as if possessed by a
spirit not my own. No one can understand my
feelings who has not been so tried, left alone in
the world, as if on the extreme verge of existence,
with the abyss yawning beneath, and at the same
time feeling something within that might merit a
saving hand at the last moment.&#8221; Suddenly, from
amid the crowd surrounding the table, a delicate
hand, gleaming with diamonds, glided over the
golden pile; but the iron hand of the Norwegian
grasped the little white one. A woman&#8217;s shriek
was heard; several voices called out, &#8220;<span lang="fr">À la porte!
à la porte!</span>&#8221; But a man near Ole Bull, in a calm,
clear voice that seemed to command all in the
room, said: &#8220;Madame, leave this gold alone;&#8221;
and to Bull: &#8220;Monsieur, take your money, if you
please.&#8221; It was his strange friend, who, as he afterwards
learned, was none other than Vidocq,
the famous Parisian chief of police. All give
way, the lady turns pale, and Ole Bull mechanically
seizes the gold, but, riveted to the spot, sees
red winning till the end of the <i>taille</i>. Had he had
the courage, and left his money there, he would
that very night have won a small fortune. Meanwhile,
he had the eight hundred francs in his
pocket; but it was only on reaching his room and
drawing them out, and hearing the metallic clink
and seeing the glitter, that he convinced himself
he was not dreaming. &#8220;What a hideous joy I
felt,&#8221; he said; &#8220;what a horrid pleasure to hold in
the hand one&#8217;s own soul saved by the spoil of
others!&#8221; Singularly enough, he never saw Vidocq<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
again. He soon learned that a man could
not be true to his art or himself who yielded to
the insane excitement of the then polite recreation
of gambling.</p>

<p>The artist&#8217;s note&#8211;book, written in pencil, tells
us that a house to which he removed through the
aid of the Swedish ambassador, Count Lovenhjelm,
was soon after invaded by cholera, which
was then epidemic in Paris, and that he walked
the deserted streets many a night, listening to the
moans of the dying in the infected houses, hastening
his steps past doors which opened for the
egress of those bearing the dead.</p>

<p>He was again reduced to want and almost hopeless.
The waters of the Seine had an alluring
sound as they murmured between the stone piers
of the bridges, while the noise and glare of the
Parisian streets, muffled or diminished by the influence
of the pest, seemed to him peculiarly
repulsive and disheartening. The idea of suicide,
however, it was easy to keep down; but how subdue
the fever which, from the despair of the moment
and the natural excitement of his nervous
system, began to affect his brain?</p>

<p>One day, while roving about the streets, he
stopped in front of No. 19 Rue des Martyrs.
He could go no farther; he was exhausted. The
house seemed to look kindly on him, and on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
little ticket in one of the windows he read: &#8220;Furnished
rooms to let.&#8221; The porter insisted that
it was a mistake, but remembered, at last, that on
the second floor lived an old lady who had recently
lost her son, and who, perhaps, might
have a vacant room. The young man ascended
the stairs, rang the bell, and was received by an
elderly and motherly&#8211;looking gentlewoman. But,
no! there was no vacant room. &#8220;Grandmamma,
look at him!&#8221; cried a young girl. The old lady
put on her glasses, and as she looked at Ole Bull
the tears filled her eyes; he resembled so strikingly
the son she had just lost. He meantime
stood with a questioning gaze. At last she said:
&#8220;Very well, Monsieur, if you please, return to&#8211;morrow
at noon&#8221; (<i lang="fr">à midi</i>). &#8220;<span lang="fr">Oui, Madame, à douze
heures.</span>&#8221; A peal of laughter from the young girl
greeted his reply, which only a foreigner would
have made. This beautiful maiden was Alexandrine
Félicie Villeminot, an orphan. She afterwards
became the wife of Ole Bull.</p>

<p>The following day found him established in
Madame Villeminot&#8217;s house. He was almost immediately
attacked by brain fever. On regaining
his consciousness he found the old lady sitting
by his bedside, and her first words were of hope
and encouragement. She assured him that he
need not worry about his means of payment, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
he felt the soothing influence of motherly care
and affection.</p>

<p>He was attended by Dr. Dufours, a celebrated
physician and an intimate friend of Thiers. His
name occurs frequently in Ole Bull&#8217;s letters, for
he was the friend and adviser of himself and his
family for many years.</p>

<p>Shortly after the young man&#8217;s recovery, his
friends in Christiania, learning of his misfortunes,
sent him three thousand francs from the Musical
Lyceum in that city. Matters now began to
mend.</p>

<p>Paganini came to Paris the winter of 1831, and
was heard for the first time by the young Norwegian,
whose notes show how carefully he studied
him.</p>

<p>About this time he tried again for a place in
the orchestra of the Opéra Comique, but in vain.
Applicants for the position were obliged to compete,
and were given a piece of music to play at
sight. To Ole Bull the piece selected seemed so
simple that, in the arrogance of youth, he asked
at which end he should begin. This offense
caused him to be rejected without a hearing.</p>

<p>One day as he was examining an instrument at
a dealer&#8217;s, he made the acquaintance of one Monsieur
Lacour, who assured him that he had discovered
a certain varnish by the use of which an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
ordinary violin would gain the sweetness and
quality of a Cremona instrument. Ole Bull
found that violins thus treated had really a fine
tone, while Monsieur Lacour, on his side, amazed
at the young man&#8217;s power, felt that he had come
across the right man to give his instruments a
reputation. He arranged with him to play on
one of them at a soirée to be given by the Duke
of Riario, Italian chargé d&#8217;affaires in Paris. There
he met a very numerous and elegant company.
He instinctively felt that Fortune was in the
room, if he could but catch her. But, because
of the intense heat, that mysterious varnish which
Monsieur Lacour applied to his violins gave forth
such an intolerable smell from the assaf&#339;tida it
contained that he became first embarrassed, then
excited, furious, wild,&#8212;and in this state he
played. When he had finished and awakened as
from a bad dream, Fortune stood before him
with smiles, compliments, congratulations, and, as
is not always her wont, with more substantial rewards.</p>

<p>The Duke of Montebello, Marshal Ney&#8217;s son,
invited him to breakfast the next day, and shortly
after, April 18, 1832, he gave his first concert
under the duke&#8217;s patronage in the German
Stoeppel&#8217;s Hall, Rue Neuve des Augustins, with
the assistance of Ernst, Chopin, and other great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
artists. His share of the proceeds was fourteen
hundred francs. He came to know Chopin intimately,
and they played often together in public
and private. George Sand, in her <i>Malgrétout</i>,
has given a charming account of the effect of
Ole Bull&#8217;s playing at that period of his life.</p>

<p>As the Grand Opéra was still closed to him,
he soon made a concert tour through Switzerland
and Italy. His first concert at Lausanne was a
great success, and he assisted at a religious festival
in Morges on Lake Geneva. From there he
went to Milan, where he gave a concert in the
Scala Theatre which brought him both money
and fame. A few days afterwards he saw in one
of the Milan journals a very severe criticism upon
his playing. What struck him, however, was not
so much its severity as its truth. It was to this
effect:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Monsieur Bull played compositions by Spohr, Mayseder,
and Paganini without understanding the true
character of the music, which he marred by adding
something of his own. It is quite obvious, that what
he adds comes from genuine and original talent, from
his own musical individuality; but he is not master of
himself; he has no style; he is an untrained musician.
If he be a diamond, he is certainly in the rough and
unpolished.</p></div>

<p>The artist went to the publisher and asked who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
had written the criticism. &#8220;If you want the responsible
person, I am he,&#8221; was the answer.
&#8220;No,&#8221; said the musician, &#8220;I have not come to
call the writer to account, but to thank him. The
man who wrote that article understands music;
but it is not enough to tell me my faults, he must
tell me how to rid myself of them.&#8221; &#8220;You have
the spirit of a true artist,&#8221; replied the journalist.
&#8220;It is a singing&#8211;master to whom I shall introduce
you. It is in the art of song that you will find
the key to the beauties of music in general, and
the hidden capacities of the violin in particular;
for the violin most resembles the human voice.&#8221;
The same evening he took Ole Bull to one of the
most famous of the <i lang="it">repetitore</i>, a man over seventy
years of age, who knew the traditions of the great
masters and artists. Ole Bull used to say that
never in his life had he been so impressed as
by this old singer whose voice was broken. He
found in his delivery and style the clue to the
power which he had admired in the great artists.
Now to him also was the secret revealed. He at
once became a pupil, devoting himself to continuous
study and practice for six months under
the guidance of able masters, throwing his whole
heart and soul into his work.</p>

<p>From this ardent study, assisted by eminent
teachers of Italian song, came his command of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
melody, which enabled him to reproduce with
their true native character the most delicate and
varied modifications of foreign music that he met
with&#8212;Italian, Spanish, Irish, Arabian, Hungarian,
as well as the national songs of his own
country. But the chief result of these studies
was, that he found himself; he learned to know
the nature and limits of his own talent, and was
able to give form to his musical feelings.</p>

<p>In a letter to a friend, at this time, he mentions
a kind of vision which he had. Worn out and
exhausted by the difficulties which he met in the
work of a new composition, his &#8220;Concerto in A
major,&#8221; his father seemed suddenly to stand before
him as he was playing, and to speak, with
his eyes rather than his lips, this warning: &#8220;The
more you overwork the more wretched you make
yourself; and the more wretched you are the
harder you will have to struggle.&#8221; Ever afterwards
he avoided over&#8211;practice, lest it should
deaden the finer sensibilities which must be relied
upon for inspiration.</p>

<p>In studying Italian music, he discovered how
great was his need of schooling; but he found,
too, that the rules taught for playing the violin
were not sufficient to help him in developing the
capacity of the instrument. He therefore kept
up, at the same time, a course of independent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
study. Here again we may quote from Mr. Goldschmidt,
who says of his studies at that time:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We will endeavor to give an exposition of the musical
principles upon which he acted, and of the means by
which he strove to bring them into practice. What was
his aim, and how did he endeavor to reach it? We have
heard of his marvelous dexterity, of wonderful &#8220;tricks&#8221;
he displayed on his violin, and of &#8220;stupendous effects&#8221;
which he produced,&#8212;and the question arises, Were
these tricks and effects the end, as some have fancied,
or were they the means to an end? I answer, they were
the means to an end, and this end was <i>to reproduce the
Hulder</i>. You will ask me to give you an idea of what
the Hulder is, not only as a popular fancy, but as a poetic
symbol. In trying to do so, let me remind you that
from the mountains, forests, and valleys of the North
proceeded that race which has conquered half the world;
from whose love, devotion, and aspirations chivalry
sprang into existence under a more Southern sky; their
yearning souls and powerful hands produced the wonders
of Gothic architecture; their blood throbs in the
veins of your proudest aristocracy; whilst the stern
tribe, remaining at home, struggling against a severe
climate, against the wild beasts of the forest, and in internal
feuds among themselves, had no other organs for
their longings, hopes, aspirations, triumphs, and woes,
than song and music. As future purple&#8211;clad kings and
emperors were hidden in the &#8220;<span lang="no">Odelsbonde</span>,&#8221;<a name="Anchor-3" id="Anchor-3"></a><a href="#Footnote-3" class="Anchor" title="Go to footnote 3.">[3]</a> who sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
out his sons as &#8220;Vikings,&#8221; so an unspeakable majesty
and delicacy is hidden in the simplicity of Northern
strains. But there is more. Amid the subdued yet intense
feeling of the glory and dignity of man, suddenly
enters the foreboding of death: there is almost always
beneath the highest mirth an under&#8211;current of melancholy,&#8212;the
pictures are golden, on a black ground.
But, at the same time, the foreboding of death augments
the feeling of life. The waters, the trees, the mountains,
live a life of their own, tempting you with the
sweetest, the most potent and secret powers of nature,
or crushing you with their colossal strength; no blind
powers, no mere creations of superstitious terror, but
always animated by a higher spirit, as behooves the
fairy beings created by a big&#8211;brained race. And, amid
all these sounds, terrible or mysterious, is heard the innocent
bell&#8211;shaped flower, accompanied by the grass of
the meadow. This may give you a faint idea of the
Hulder&#8212;the spirit of the North. Southern music generally
consists of sounds that please the ear, whilst
Northern music strives to tell you secret tales of your
own soul.</p>

<p>It was the Hulder which Ole Bull would reproduce
on the violin; but when he came to feel what really
moved itself within him&#8212;what musical soul it was that
craved for a body, a frame, a voice&#8212;the violin put into
his hand and the received rules for its use were but ill&#8211;fitted
to assist him in solving the problem. Therefore,
descending from the heights of enthusiasm, he began
to study the rudiments, and, first of all, the principle
on which the old violins&#8212;the old master&#8211;makers&#8217; violins&#8212;were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
constructed. It has been said that those
violins owe their excellence to their age alone. Why is
it, then, that the Cremonese instruments are almost human
in their temper and character of tone, while contemporary
instruments from the Tyrol, etc., are now
worth nothing? Whether the Italian masters worked
with unconscious ingenuity, or acted upon the principles
well known to their great musical epoch, certain it
is that their violins, like the buried soul of the legend,
challenge a searching question for the betrayal of their
secret.</p></div>

<p>At the end of his six months&#8217; study he went
from Milan to Venice where his performances
created an excitement, and he was made a member
of the Philharmonic Society. There and in
Trieste his improvisations awakened the liveliest
interest, and the extremely enthusiastic criticisms
of Dr. Jael made his name known in Vienna.
But he could not then visit that city, as his
thoughts and longings turned toward the South.
He went first to Bologna, where, in the most extraordinary
way, he won the great celebrity which
followed him ever afterwards, by one of those
happenings in human life, stranger than those
which fancy creates, and making visible, as it
were, the hand of Providence. It was from
Bologna that his friends at home first received
the news of his triumphs.</p>

<p>Bologna was, at that time, reputed the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
musical city in Italy; and its Philharmonic
Society, under the direction of the Marquis Zampieri,
was recognized as one of the greatest authorities
in the musical world. Madame Malibran
had been engaged by the directors of the
theatre for a series of nights; but she had made
a condition which compelled them to give the use
of the theatre without charge to De Beriot, with
whom she was to appear in two concerts. Zampieri
seized the opportunity of persuading these
artists to appear in a Philharmonic concert. All
was arranged and announced, when, by chance,
Malibran heard that De Beriot was to receive in
recognition of his services a smaller sum than
had been stipulated for herself. Piqued at this,
she sent word that she could not appear on account
of indisposition, and De Beriot himself declared
that he was suffering from a sprained
thumb.</p>

<p>Ole Bull had now been a fortnight in Bologna.
He occupied an upper room in a poor hotel, a
sort of soldiers&#8217; barracks, where he had been
obliged to take temporary refuge, because of the
neglect of a friend to send him a money&#8211;order.
Secluded from society, he spent the days in writing
on his concerto; and when evening came, and
the wonderful tones of his violin sounded from
the open windows, the people would assemble in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the street below to listen. One evening the celebrated
Colbran (Rossini&#8217;s first wife, and a native
of Bologna) was passing Casa Soldati and heard
those strains. She paused. The sounds seemed
to come from an instrument she had never heard
before. &#8220;It must be a violin,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but a
divine one, which will be a substitute for De
Beriot and Malibran. I must go and tell Zampieri.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the night of the concert, Ole Bull, having
retired very early on account of weariness, had
already been in bed two hours, when he was
roused by a rap on the door, and the exclamation,
&#8220;<span lang="it">Cospetto di Bacco!</span> What stairs!&#8221; It
was Zampieri, the most eminent musician of the
Italian nobility, a man known from Mont Cenis
to Cape Spartivento. He asks Ole Bull to improvise
for him; and then cries, &#8220;Malibran may
now have her headaches!&#8221; He must off to the
theatre at once with the young artist. There is
no time even for change of dress, and the violinist
is hurried before a disappointed but most distinguished
audience. The Grand Duke of Tuscany
was there, and De Beriot with his hand in a
sling. It seemed to Ole Bull that he had been
transported by magic, and at first that he could
not meet the cold, critical exactions of the people
before him; for he knew his appearance was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
against him, and his weariness had almost unnerved
him. He chose his own composition, and
the very desperation of the moment, which compelled
him to shut his eyes and forget his surroundings,
made him play with an <i>abandon</i>, an
ecstasy of feeling, which charmed and captivated
his audience. As the curtain fell and he almost
swooned from exhaustion, the house shook with
reiterated applause.</p>

<p>When, after taking food and wine, he appeared
with renewed strength and courage, he asked
three ladies, whose cold, critical manner had
chilled him on his first entrance, for themes to
improvise upon. The wife of Prince Poniatowsky
gave him one from &#8220;Norma,&#8221; and the ladies at
her side, one each from the &#8220;Siege of Corinth&#8221;
and &#8220;Romeo and Juliet.&#8221; His improvisation, in
which it occurred to him to unite all these melodies,
renewed the excitement. The final piece
was to be a violin solo. The director was doubtful
of Ole Bull&#8217;s strength, but he stepped forth
firmly, saying, &#8220;I will play! oh, you must let me
play!&#8221; and again the same unrestrained enthusiasm
followed. When he finished there was
a rain of flowers, and he was congratulated by
Zampieri, De Beriot, and the principal musicians
present. He was at once engaged for the following
concert, and the assistance of the society was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
offered for a concert of his own. One gentleman
asked for sixty tickets, another for one hundred,
and Emile Loup, the owner of a large theatre in
Bologna, offered him his house and orchestra
free of expense.</p>

<p>The wheel of fortune was turning in his favor;
the Norns were now weaving bright threads in
the web of his life. He played at both concerts,
was accompanied to his hotel by a torch&#8211;light procession,
made honorary member of the Philharmonic
Society, and his carriage drawn home by
the populace. This was Ole Bull&#8217;s real <i>début</i>.</p>

<p>Malibran was at first angry, and would neither
see nor hear him. He had superseded the man
she loved, and she possibly suspected some intrigue.
At last she allowed him to be introduced,
and civilly asked him to play something. After
the first tones the blood rushed to her face, and
when he had finished she exclaimed: &#8220;Signor
Ole Bull, it is indeed your own fault that I did
not treat you as you deserved. A man like you
should step forth with head erect in the full light
of day, that we may recognize his noble blood.&#8221;
From that time she had for him not only a
friendly but an affectionate interest. Another
day when he was playing at her house, she said:
&#8220;He has a much sweeter tone than you, De
Beriot.&#8221; The latter thought that the superiority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
lay in the instrument, but failed on trial to satisfy
her of this.</p>

<p>One night at the opera Ole Bull, who was
standing at the side of the stage, was so completely
overcome by the dramatic power and the
glorious voice of the great artist, that, unconsciously
to himself, the tears were streaming down
his face. Suddenly Malibran caught sight of him,
turned for a moment from the audience, and
without interruption perceptible to them made a
most absurd grimace. The discovery of her entire
self&#8211;control while she moved others to the utmost
was a disappointment which he could not
afterward disguise, but she laughingly excused it
by saying: &#8220;It would not do for both of us to
blubber;&#8221; and when he thought what a comic
sight his face must have been he could not help
joining in the laugh.</p>

<p>Another evening, having invited him to supper
after the performance, Malibran insisted on hurrying
him off in her carriage, and, running up the
stairs to her rooms before him, she threw over
him as he entered a large cape, tied on his head
an old&#8211;fashioned bonnet, and, pulling down a veil
over his face, pushed him into a chair in the
corner behind the table just as the rest of the
party were heard outside. Putting her finger to
her lips to warn him to be silent, she introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
each guest in turn to her &#8220;aunt just arrived from
the country;&#8221; but after they had taken seats at
the table a few cuts with her riding&#8211;whip sent
bonnet and cape flying from the head and
shoulders of her respectable relative.</p>

<p>Among the strangers who came to Bologna
to attend Ole Bull&#8217;s concerts was Prince Carlo
Poniatowsky, who invited the artist to visit Florence;
and on the 2d of May, 1834, he gave a
concert there in the Cocomero Theatre. His
&#8220;Concerto in A major,&#8221; made the same sensation
as in Bologna. He used to say that from that
concert in Florence dated his confidence in his
own powers.</p>

<p>He gave two more concerts there assisted by
such artists as Duprez and Madame Ronzi de
Begnis. At this time he composed his &#8220;<span lang="it">Quartetto
a Violino Solo</span>,&#8221; and his &#8220;<span lang="it">Adagio Religioso:
Preghiera d&#8217;una Madre</span>,&#8221; written for the friars of
Santa Maria Novello at Florence. The circumstances
attending its composition are pleasantly
told by Mrs. Child.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The monks wanted some new music for their church.
Ole Bull had promised it, but neglected from day to day
to write it. At last, they waited upon him early in the
morning, and told him it must be ready for rehearsal
the next day. &#8220;I was in bed when they came,&#8221; said
he; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>&#8220;I had been up all night with the moon, sympathizing
with her. I had thought of Norway, of home,
of many sad things. I said to the Dominicans that
they should have the music the next morning. I took
my violin, and it sang to me so sweetly the thoughts of
the night! I wrote down its voice, and as this brought
before me the image of a mother kneeling at the altar,
entreating for her child, I called it &#8216;The Mother&#8217;s
Prayer.&#8217; The Dominicans complained that it was too
plaintive. They said that they already had so much
sad, solemn music, they wanted something cheerful. So
I composed something in a more lively strain for them.&#8221;
This was the motive to the &#8220;<span lang="it">Polacca Guerriera</span>,&#8221; which
had occurred to him while looking at Vesuvius, and
which he now wrote out for the monks on the spot, giving
it an introduction and accompaniment for the organ.</p></div>

<p>These friars became very warmly attached to
him, and tried hard to persuade him to join their
fraternity. &#8220;A tame finale,&#8221; as Mrs. Child remarks,
&#8220;this would have been to the life opera
which began with swinging to the winds in the
tops of Norwegian pines.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the hot months he retired to Pierro a
Silve, a small village hanging high in the clefts
of the Apennines. He carried a letter from the
prior of Santa Maria to the prior of the cloister
there. While in this mountain retreat he composed
a trio, and wrote a &#8220;Grammar of the Violin&#8221;
for his own use.</p>

<p>In the course of that season, he visited the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
famous baths of Lucca. Prince Poniatowsky was
there, as also the Duke of Tuscany, the Duke of
Lucca, and the Queen Dowager of Naples. Malibran,
De Beriot, and Döhler, the pianist, had
come all the way from Sinigaglia to hear him.
The morning before the concert he was to play at
the Duke of Lucca&#8217;s. After the introduction by
the piano had been played, a buzz of conversation
was kept up, in which the Queen Dowager
was taking a prominent part. Döhler whispered
to Ole Bull not to mind it, and begin his solo;
but he quietly placed his violin under his arm in
the attitude of waiting. The duke stepped forward
and asked if he desired anything. &#8220;I am
quite ready, your Grace, but fear to interrupt the
conversation. The Queen Dowager has probably
something of importance to impart, and I
would not disturb her.&#8221; Saying he would speak
to her, the duke crossed the room, and, after a
whispered sentence, she lifted her eyeglass to scan
the spirited young artist; but he was not again annoyed
by conversation. The next morning, Ole
Bull met on the promenade Mr. Schmucker, one
of the gentlemen in attendance on the Queen.
He said he had come from her Majesty, who desired
to see him, and proposed that he should immediately
present him. The Queen opened the
conversation by remarking that she supposed they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
had a great many bears in Norway, to which Ole
Bull replied that he had himself had the good
fortune to be nursed by one, and that he should
always hold in grateful remembrance its tender
devotion to him. &#8220;But why,&#8221; she asked, &#8220;would
you not play last evening?&#8221; &#8220;I did not wish to
disturb your Majesty&#8217;s conversation.&#8221; &#8220;Oh! I
understood that you were offended; but you must
overcome that sensitiveness. In Neapolitan society,
conversation always goes on during music.&#8221;
&#8220;I should not think of visiting a city so barbarous,
where music is considered a mere recreation
to lighten the tedium of more important occupations,
your Majesty.&#8221; &#8220;But you must come! I
sent for you to ask you, and I assure you that
you shall have none but silent listeners, for you
deserve them.&#8221; The Queen continued to show
her kindly interest, giving him most valuable letters
of introduction, and she often used her influence
in his behalf, as he found out later.</p>

<p>By way of Pisa, Leghorn, and Lucca,&#8212;where
he once more met with Prince Poniatowsky,&#8212;he
went in the autumn to Naples. The Neapolitans,
like the Bolognese, were reputed for their highly
cultivated musical taste; but in Naples it was
vocal music which was especially appreciated, and
the city, when Ole Bull arrived, was ringing with
shouts and plaudits for Madame Malibran. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
waited for the conclusion of her engagement, and
then played in the Theatre of San Carlo. After
he had finished his &#8220;<span lang="it">Quartetto a Violino Solo</span>,&#8221;
and the audience were wild with enthusiasm, De
Beriot exclaimed: &#8220;What sorcery must a violin
possess to electrify the Neapolitans!&#8221; As Ole
Bull left the stage after the last piece, De Beriot
met him, and asked that he would wait until Malibran
could come to him; he of course rushed to
her box, where she received him with open arms,
embracing him amid the plaudits of the vast audience.</p>

<p>He gave several concerts in Naples, but during
his stay he met with a sad loss. His Santo Seraphino,
his dear violin, which he had used in his
first concert at Paris, which Chopin had helped
him to procure, and with which he had won his
first laurels, was stolen from him. He saw it
again, many years later, in Moscow, in the possession
of a Russian nobleman, to whom he told its
history. To take its place, he bought in Naples
a Nicholas Amati.</p>

<p>February 5, 1835, Ole Bull went to Rome. He
led a merry life among the artists there during
the Carnival. Several of these were Northmen,
among whom were the Norse landscape artist,
Fearnley, &#8220;the best fellow in the world,&#8221; and
Thorwaldsen. It was at this time that Ole Bull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
completed his &#8220;<span lang="it">Polacca Guerriera</span>.&#8221; The circumstances
of its composition are given as told by
Mrs. Child.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The &#8220;<span lang="it">Polacca Guerriera</span>&#8221; was first conceived at Naples,
alone at midnight, gazing on Mount Vesuvius
flaming through the darkness. He went to Rome soon
after, and carried the vague conception in his mind, intending
to arrange it there, and bring it out at his last
concert. At Rome, he shared the apartment of a talented
young artist, who became warmly attached to him.
The intimate relation between music and painting was
a favorite theme with this young man, and, to the musician,
the sounds of an orchestra had always suggested
colors. When he slept late in the morning, the artist
would often rouse him by saying, &#8220;Come, Ole, get up
and play to me! I can&#8217;t paint unless you play to me.&#8221;
Being urged and urged, he would at last shake off
his drowsiness, and, half dressed, begin to play. The
violin would soon absorb him, till an exclamation from
the painter broke in upon his reverie: &#8220;Ah, dear Ole,
give me that once more, it is such a brilliant red!&#8221;
or, &#8220;Play that again, dear Ole, it is such a heavenly
blue!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thorwaldsen, who was then at Rome, loved Ole Bull
with most devoted affection, and delighted in his genius.
These friends, of course, felt a deep interest in his success.
From day to day they would ask whether he had
done any thing toward completing the Polacca. His
answer always was, &#8220;No, but I <i>shall</i> do it.&#8221; As the
time for the concert drew nigh, they remonstrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
against such dangerous delay. &#8220;How can you be so
careless of your fame, Ole?&#8221; said Thorwaldsen; &#8220;do
try to have this new piece done in season; if not for
your own sake, at least for mine; for, independent of
my affection for you, you know I claim you as a countryman,
and my pride of country is at stake.&#8221;<a name="Anchor-4" id="Anchor-4"></a><a href="#Footnote-4" class="Anchor" title="Go to footnote 4.">[4]</a></p>

<p>The concert was advertised, and the Polacca was in
the programme; still it had no existence, except in the
musician&#8217;s soul. &#8220;<i>Have</i> you written that music?&#8221; said
Thorwaldsen. &#8220;<i>Are</i> you crazy?&#8221; inquired the painter.
But he would throw his arms around them, and laugh
and jest, as if his musical reputation concerned everybody
more than it did himself. The day before the
concert his friends were in despair when they saw him
prepare to go out after breakfast. &#8220;Have you written
any of that music?&#8221; said they, entreatingly. &#8220;No,
my dear friends, but I have it all here,&#8221; replied he, playfully
touching his forehead. They urged that the concert
was to be the next day, and that the piece must be
rehearsed. &#8220;I will do it this evening,&#8221; said he. &#8220;You
are an imprudent man,&#8221; they replied; &#8220;the public of
Rome will not bear such treatment even from a favorite
like yourself; you will make a complete failure.&#8221; He
laughed, and coaxed them caressingly not to be troubled
on his account. The evening was far spent when he
returned. The artist, in anxious tones, asked, &#8220;Dear
Ole, <i>have</i> you done anything about that music?&#8221; &#8220;No,
I have not had time.&#8221; &#8220;Well, do set about it this moment.&#8221;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>&#8220;Oh, I cannot; I am so tired that I must go
directly to bed.&#8221; In vain the artist remonstrated and
entreated. A spirit of mischief had taken possession
of the wayward minstrel. He plunged into bed, and
soon pretended to be sound asleep. The young man
had the habit of talking to himself; and as he listened
to the bass solo of the counterfeit sleeper, he muttered,
&#8220;How <i>can</i> he go to sleep with nothing done about that
music? It is more than I can comprehend. I wish I
could feel as easy about it as he does.&#8221; He retired to
rest early, and as soon as he was fairly asleep, Ole
sprang out of bed, lighted a candle, and stepped softly
into an adjoining room, where he began to write down
his music with prestissimo speed. The outline had
long been in his mind, and new thoughts for the filling
up came with a rush of inspiration. He wrote as fast
as the pen could fly. At four o&#8217;clock the score for all
the orchestral parts was written out. For his violin
part he trusted entirely to his own wonderful memory.
Having arranged all, he crept quietly back into bed.
The artist, who was an early riser, soon began to stir.
Ole breathed sonorously, as if he were in a deep sleep.
&#8220;Still asleep!&#8221; murmured his friend: &#8220;as quietly as if
the music were all ready for the orchestra. I wish we
were safely through this evening.&#8221; It was not long before
his anxiety took a more active form. He began to
shake the sleeper, saying, &#8220;Ole, do wake up, and try to
do something about that music.&#8221; But he obtained only
the drowsy answer, &#8220;Oh I cannot, I am so very sleepy.&#8221;
Vexed and discouraged, the painter went to his easel,
and said no more. At breakfast, Ole was full of fun
and frolic; but Thorwaldsen and the artist were somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
impatient with what they deemed such thoughtless
trifling with public expectation. &#8220;You will come
to my concert to&#8211;night, will you not?&#8221; said the mischievous
musician. In dismal tones, they replied, &#8220;No,
Ole, we love you too well to witness your disgrace. Take
it as lightly as you please; but you may be assured the
public of Rome will not bear such treatment.&#8221; &#8220;Oh,
do come,&#8221; pleaded the musician coaxingly, &#8220;just a little,
<i>little</i> within the door; and then when I am disgraced,
you can easily slip away.&#8221; They would not promise,
however, and he hurried off to keep his appointment
with the orchestra. He had an excellent band of musicians,
who could play the most difficult music with the
slightest preparation. The rehearsal went off to his
complete satisfaction, and he returned to his friends as
gay as a lark. His apparent recklessness made them
still more sad. The dreaded evening came. The house
was crowded. Ole was full of that joyful confidence
which genius is so apt to feel in effusions that have
just burst freshly from its overflowing fountain. The
orchestra delighted in the composition and played it
with their hearts. The brilliancy of the theme and the
uncommon beauty of the <i>cantabile</i> took the audience by
surprise. The novelty and marvelous difficulty of the
finale, in which the violin alone performs four distinct
parts and keeps up a continuous shake through fifteen
bars, completely electrified them. There was a perfect
tempest of applause. In the midst of his triumph, the
composer, looking as quiet and demure as possible,
glanced toward the door. There stood Thorwaldsen
and the artist. The latter had a trick of moving tobacco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
from one side of his mouth to the other when he
was excited and pleased. It was now flying from cheek
to cheek almost as rapidly as the violin bow through
the continuous shake of fifteen bars.</p>

<p>The moment he left the stage his friends rushed
into his arms, exclaiming, &#8220;When on earth did you
do it? Only tell us that. Oh, it was too beautiful!&#8221;
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so gay, my dear friends,&#8221; replied he, with
mock gravity; &#8220;you know the public of Rome won&#8217;t
bear such trifling. Why did you come to witness my
disgrace?&#8221;</p>

<p>The next day all Rome was ringing with praises of
the Norwegian violinist. They knew not which to applaud
most, his genius or his superhuman strength in
performing the four distinct parts on the violin at once,
and keeping up the motion of his bow with such lightning
swiftness, for so long a time. No person who has
not tried it can conceive of the extreme difficulty of
playing at once distinct parts on each of the strings. It
requires muscles strong as iron, and elastic as india&#8211;rubber.
Paganini had sufficient elasticity, but not sufficient
strength. Ole Bull is the only man in the world
that ever did it. When the Parisians first heard him
produce this wonderful effect of four violins, it seemed
so incredible, that a story was circulated that it was all
a deception; that some other musician was playing two
of the parts behind the scenes. Thus originated the
charge of &#8220;charlatanry,&#8221; so often and so unjustly repeated.</p>

<p>The Polacca brought its composer a brilliant reputation
at once; and musical critics were obliged to content<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
themselves with saying that it was not written in
the right measure for a Polacca.</p></div>

<p>In May he went from Rome directly to Paris.
The doors of the Grand Opéra were now open to
him, and he gave several concerts there, making
some provincial tours in the intervals. From his
second appearance at the Grand Opéra dates
Jules Janin&#8217;s criticism written for the <i lang="fr">Journal
des Débats</i>. Wergeland says:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In spite of the half ludicrous self&#8211;assertion of its
author, and the unnecessary prominence given to his
own personality, it is a very happy piece of art criticism.
Jules Janin had a wonderful power of making
other people see, hear, and feel as he saw, heard, and
felt. His opinions became the opinions of the world.
As if with a wizard&#8217;s wand, he made a fame, and it was
only when he tried to unmake one that his own vulnerable
points were exposed. In the present case, he hit
most happily upon just those features in Ole Bull&#8217;s
genius and character, which were sure to win sympathy&#8212;the
simplicity, the brightness, the sweet innocence,
which in his music suddenly rises from the chaos of
tumultuous passion, and the naïveté, generosity, and
warm devotion, which in his personal intercourse with
men were so singularly blended with his fierce hatred
of all intrigue and malice.</p>

<p>In Norway we read this criticism with great delight.
It was the legal rite duly performed. The last anxiety
disappeared. Ole Bull was now in the eyes of all the
world the great genius, the perfect artist.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Jules Janin&#8217;s criticism (which would only be
marred by translation) was as follows:<a name="Anchor-5" id="Anchor-5"></a><a href="#Footnote-5" class="Anchor" title="Go to footnote 5.">[5]</a>&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot" lang="fr">

<p class="center">M. OLE B. BULL.</p>

<p>Ce jeune sauvage, qui nous est venu l&#8217;an passé des
glaces de la Norwège, son Stradivarius à la main, s&#8217;est
fait entendre pour la seconde fois à l&#8217;opéra, lundi passé.
C&#8217;est tout à fait le grand musicien que je vous avais
prédit il y a six mois. Il y a tant de larmes et tant de
mélancolie dans ce noble instrument! Il y a tant d&#8217;énergie
et de vigeur et tant de grace sous cet archet de
fer! Il chante, il pleure, il se passionne; tantôt il élève
la voix au dessus des cors et des trombones; tantôt il
soupire si doucement qu&#8217;on dirait une harpe éolienne!
C&#8217;est un musicien qui n&#8217;a pas eu de maitre. C&#8217;est un
violon qui n&#8217;appartient à aucune école. C&#8217;est quelque
chose de naïf et d&#8217;inspiré et d&#8217;une puissance incroyable.
On a beaucoup parlé de M. Paganini et de sa quatrième
corde. Ils s&#8217;étaient fait annoncer, l&#8217;une portant l&#8217;autre,
par toutes les voix de la renommée. Ils étaient venus,
la quatrième corde tendue outre mesure, et celui qui en
devait jouer, aussi mal peigné qu&#8217;on peut l&#8217;être quand
on le fait exprès. Eh bien! je ne sais pas, si le succès
de M. Bull, le Norwégien, n&#8217;eût pas été aussi grand que
le succès de l&#8217;Italien et de sa quatrième corde, s&#8217;il avait
pris soin de s&#8217;entourer du puissant charlatanisme de
son confrère. Mais, que voulez vous? La Norwège est
une bonne fille bien simple et bien honnête, qui ne met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
pas de fard. Elle arrive tout simplement et jette au
dehors naturellement et sans efforts tout ce qu&#8217;elle a
dans l&#8217;âme et dans le c&#339;ur! M. Ole B. Bull est un
de ces artistes pleins d&#8217;ignorance, de naïveté, et de
bonne foi, qui ne demandent pas mieux que de s&#8217;abandonner
à leur belle et bonne nature en plein jour, en
plein air et en toute liberté. C&#8217;est un honnête jeune
homme sans charlatanisme, qui ignore le grand art Italien
de préparer un succès de longue main. Depuis le
premier jour ou je l&#8217;entendis à l&#8217;opéra, en toute admiration,
je l&#8217;avoue, le hasard me l&#8217;a fait entendre souvent
çà et là, sur toutes les grandes routes et sur tous les
théâtres de province, et toujours cependant j&#8217;ai retrouvé
le même talent, la même inspiration passionée et le
même enthousiasme naïf et plein de c&#339;ur. Un jour
dans une auberge de Rouen, j&#8217;ai été réveillé par un
adagio melancolique et tendre, c&#8217;était le violon d&#8217;Ole
Bull. Une autre fois dans un cabaret de grande route
un plaintif andante m&#8217;est venu surprendre, assis au&#8211;devant
de la porte, sous le bouchon qui servait d&#8217;en&#8211;seigne,
c&#8217;était un andante de mon violon favori. Il a
été toute ma providence poétique. L&#8217;été passé, dans
cette ennuyeuse ville de Dieppe, pleine d&#8217;Anglais ennuyés
et d&#8217;Anglaises d&#8217;antichambre couvertes d&#8217;un voile
vert, Ole Bull m&#8217;a consolé de la mer de Dieppe, cette
horrible mer qui rend malades les gens bien portants.
Même je le vois encore, accompagné d&#8217;une façon si burlesque
par la société dite philharmonique de cette honnête
ville, à ce point, que Meyerbeer qui était là, ne
pouvant supporter plus longtemps cet accompagnement
barbare, est allé se jeter dans la mer en tenant ses
oreilles à deux mains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>J&#8217;ai donc conservé un tendre souvenir pour ce grand
artiste que j&#8217;ai trouvé ainsi sur ma route, pour en
charmer les ennuis. Ce n&#8217;est pas celui&#8211;là qui s&#8217;enfermerait
dans sa chambre comme un voleur, pour tirer de
son violon les plus doux accords; au contraire, il jetait
sa pensée à qui voulait l&#8217;entendre, comme on jette sa
petite monnaie aux pauvres du chemin; ce n&#8217;est pas celui&#8211;là
qui mettrait à son violon une avare sourdine; au
contraire, il n&#8217;était jamais plus joyeux que lorsqu&#8217;il y
avait foule autour de lui pour l&#8217;entendre, pour l&#8217;applaudir
et pour pleurer gratis; aussi a&#8211;t&#8211;il recueillé partout sur
son passage, sinon beaucoup d&#8217;or, du moins d&#8217;honorables
sympathies. Les Anglais vagabonds n&#8217;ont pas été
à son concert, mais les jeunes gens y sont venus, et les
plus pauvres, car c&#8217;était ce pauvre musicien lui&#8211;même
qui ouvrait sa porte et qui disait; entrez! sans exiger
qu&#8217;on prit son billet à la porte. Voilà comment il faut
soutenir la dignité de l&#8217;instrument que vous a departi
le ciel. Il faut savoir donner quelques leçons de générosité
à ces villes égoistes de la province qui ne savent
pas que c&#8217;est un devoir pour elles d&#8217;encourager un grand
musicien qui passe. Il faut savoir donner pour rien les
nobles plaisirs que la foule ne sait pas acheter; on revient
pauvre, il est vrai, de ces parages, mais qu&#8217;importe,
puisqu&#8217;on revient honoré et honorable? On n&#8217;a pas le
revenu et les sept millions de Paganini; mais qu&#8217;importe?
M. Baillot à votre retour vous tend la main et
vous dit: Mon frère! Et puis n&#8217;est ce donc rien que
d&#8217;avoir le droit de revenir à Paris et de trouver toujours
l&#8217;opéra ouvert, et d&#8217;avoir à ses ordres cet admirable orchestre
de M. Habeneck, et de venir là sans saluer trop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
bas recueillir des marques unanimes d&#8217;estime et d&#8217;admiration?</p></div>

<p>Jules Janin always called Ole Bull &#8220;<span lang="fr">mon sauvage</span>.&#8221;
This was because, when making his first
appearance at the Grand Opéra, his last step at
the side of the stage, before coming in view of
the public, was a misstep. He stumbled on a projecting
piece of framework, and was thrown so
violently forward that, to save himself from falling
headlong, he was obliged to run out. It was
as unconventional and awkward a manner of saluting
the public as can be imagined, and especially
unfortunate in that it was a Parisian audience,
who have so keen a sense of the ridiculous.
Nor was this all. In the midst of the finale of
the &#8220;<span lang="it">Polacca Guerriera</span>,&#8221; the A string snapped.
Ole Bull turned deathly pale. Monsieur Habeneck
immediately offered his violin to the artist;
but he dared not use any instrument but his own.
With the courage of despair, he transposed the
remainder of the piece, and finished it on three
strings. The strain and tension necessary for the
accomplishment of such a feat were appreciated
by Meyerbeer, who occupied Jules Janin&#8217;s box
and witnessed this incident, which others could
not believe, although they heard the snap of the
string, because of the brilliant and successful
conclusion of the performance. As Meyerbee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>r&#8217;s
voice rang out above the thunder of applause,
Ole Bull said it seemed to him like a voice from
heaven.</p>

<p>In 1879, while performing Paganini&#8217;s &#8220;Second
Concerto,&#8221; in the midst of the Adagio the E
string broke. The accompanists were startled,
but the movement was finished without a change
of reading, harmonics being substituted for the
high notes of the E string. As they left the
stage, Mr. Maurice Strakosch reminded Ole Bull,
who stood over his violin&#8211;case in the dressing&#8211;room,
that the audience were calling vociferously.
&#8220;But I can&#8217;t go out, man, until I put on my E
string!&#8221; &#8220;<i lang="fr">Mon Dieu!</i>&#8221; exclaimed the impressario,
&#8220;did it really break? I could not believe my
ears.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ole Bull used to say, &#8220;If you have the audience
under your spell, never break it by a change
of instruments, even for a broken string;&#8221; and
on no occasion was he unnerved, even when a
wretched orchestral accompaniment ruined his
effects, intentionally or otherwise; but, as he said,
the tortures he suffered under such circumstances
were &#8220;the tortures of the damned.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the summer of 1836 he was married. He
had felt the most affectionate attachment for Madame
Villeminot and her granddaughter from his
first acquaintance with them. He was very sensible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of the debt of gratitude which he owed this
motherly friend, and felt that his life had been
saved by her care when he had no one else to
whom he could turn for help. She thus writes
him in 1833:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Try to be careful of yourself on this long journey, if
not for your own sake, for the sake of us, who feel so
deeply interested in your welfare. Shall I confess to
you, sir, that, since the day of your departure, the hours
seem years to us? I can hardly realize that it is but
one month since you left us.</p></div>

<p>She goes on to assure him of her esteem and
sincere attachment, begging him to remember
her kindly advice that he should be economical.
In May, 1834, he writes:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dear Félicie, I cannot write a letter to your grandmother
without sending you a friendly word to thank
you for your letter forwarded to me from Geneva....
I should have returned before this to Paris, but I would
not go back until I had made my reputation and some
money, to carry out my plans; but Fortune did not
smile upon me at first. It is better with me now....
In Bologna I performed a concerto of mine with full
orchestra, the execution of which seemed impossible to
those who heard it. My style is much more animated
and more refined than formerly.... Please write me
at once, and tell me everything&#8212;how Mamma is, as I
am in the greatest anxiety about you all. If I can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of any service to you, dispose of me, and you will give
me the greatest pleasure. I will even leave Italy if
your welfare requires it, and come to you.... I shall
stay here one month longer. What a beautiful country
Italy is! Speak sincerely to me, keep for me your esteem
and friendship, and believe me always your true
friend and obedient servant,</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Ole Bull</span>.
</p></div>

<p>The letters following this were written after
his engagement. During a serious illness of
Madame Villeminot, he was called to her bedside.
She told him how much she desired the
protection of a loving friend for her grandchild,
whom she feared she was soon to leave; that she
believed them adapted to secure each other&#8217;s
happiness, and desired to see them betrothed.
His letters during his engagement and married
life express his tender, passionate devotion to
wife and children. Some time after their marriage
he writes: &#8220;The word <i>home</i> has above all
others the greatest charm for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>When a young man in the first flush of triumph
and adulation, he suggested mutual study
and work, that their heart and home life might
year by year become the richer, more helpful to
each other and those whom they influenced.</p>

<p>In speaking of his early ideal, we may also allude
here to his later life; how he brought cheer
and a tender thought of others ever to his home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
He was generously appreciative of all practical
helps. His strong, impulsive nature was balanced
by a kindly readiness to yield to the desire and
happiness of another. His spirit and sense of
justice would not brook personal narrowness of
feeling, but a direct and dispassionate opposition
commanded his respect, often his approval, always
his consideration.</p>

<p>A true, open&#8211;hearted friend might safely venture
on severe criticism, and his love would bear
the test even if this was sometimes cruel as regarded
his motives. He readily forgave a wrong
to himself, though an injury to a friend was not
forgotten if forgiven. His faults and failings
were always open and manifest, but his gentle
courtesy in his most intimate relations, unfailing
when most needed, cannot be told.</p>

<p>However trying or commonplace the circumstances
of his life might be, his resources of
thought, aspiration, and work gave him hours of
experience in each day which transformed for
him and those in sympathy with him the hard
realities of life,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Clothing the palpable and familiar</span><br />
<span class="i0">With golden exhalations of the dawn.&#8221;</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>After a series of six concerts in Lyons in the
early part of the year of 1836, he had a severe
illness, which nearly cost him his life. On his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
recovery he hastened back to Paris to play at
the Italian Opera. He had been promised the
theatre, but saw an announcement in the papers
of Thalberg&#8217;s concerts to be given there. He
hurried to Rossini, who was one of the directors,
and asked him what it meant. &#8220;I am sorry that
it is not in my power to help you,&#8221; said Rossini;
&#8220;the government has the entire control in this
matter. Have you a letter from Metternich?&#8221;
Thalberg, by the by, had brought a letter from
the great Austrian to the Paris authorities.
&#8220;No,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;Then follow my advice
and go to England this very day. This will be
a very favorable time for you there.&#8221;</p>

<p>It may be said here that Rossini&#8217;s kindness
and courtesy were as constant as the charm of
his ready repartee and wit in conversation. Ole
Bull always delighted to recall reminiscences of
him.</p>

<p>The violinist determined to follow Rossini&#8217;s
advice and went to London. Mr. Laporte, the
director of the Italian Opera, with whom he was
soon on good terms, promised him the theatre,
and the orchestra under the direction of Costa,
for his concerts. This, however, stirred the bad
blood of Mori, the first violin of the orchestra,
who intrigued against Ole Bull, describing him
to Costa and the critics as a mere charlatan, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
impudent and stupid imitator of Paganini. He
went even further. When the time for the first
rehearsal was fixed, he contrived very adroitly
that Ole Bull&#8217;s notice should read two o&#8217;clock,
while the orchestra were called for twelve o&#8217;clock.
His object was to give the orchestra the impression
that Ole Bull was indifferent to their convenience,
and by the long detention to arouse their
indignation. This partially succeeded. Ole Bull
felt that there were influences at work against
him, and determined not to be wholly unprepared,
although he did not know on whom to fix
his suspicion. He invited a number of friends
and musical critics to the rehearsal, and a considerable
audience had assembled at the hour.
When he himself arrived he found but a remnant
of the orchestra left, and no leader. Where was
Monsieur Costa? Where was Monsieur Laporte?
The notification for rehearsal in his hand read
distinctly two o&#8217;clock. The violinist rushed to
the cashier&#8217;s office, and seizing the man in his
strong arms, compelled him to go and announce
to the audience that M. Costa had notified Monsieur
Ole Bull that the hour of rehearsal was two
o&#8217;clock. With violin in hand Ole Bull then
said: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>&#8220;You must either think, gentlemen, that I
do not need an accompaniment, or that you are
unable to play one. I can only accept your intention
as a compliment, and express my thanks
in our mutual language&#8212;that of tone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Excited as he was, he played his &#8220;<span lang="it">Quartetto
a Violino Solo</span>,&#8221; and won the hearty applause
of those present. He then played &#8220;God save
the King&#8221; on four strings, and the house resounded
with shouts. Some persons in the street
heard the noise and rushed in to learn what it all
meant. Among them were Lord Burgesh and
Moscheles. The members of the orchestra present
now felt chagrined, and offered to accompany
him, but there was no leader. Lord Burgesh
urged Moscheles to take the bâton, which he did,
applauded warmly by the audience; but only a
few bars had been played when Costa rushed out
upon him with bitter taunts and insults. Pale
with anger Ole Bull approached the director, and
expressed to him his indignation that he had
failed to perceive the generous service Moscheles
was rendering them both. M. Laporte, who
understood that the young artist&#8217;s victory over
this intrigue was sure to win him favor, now exerted
himself to make peace. At the next rehearsal
the orchestra did their duty, and the
house was crowded at the concert, which was a
brilliant success. Ole Bull writes to Madlle. Villeminot,
May 20, 1836:&#8212;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>To&#8211;morrow is the day for my first concert. I have
to&#8211;day had the third rehearsal with full orchestra. It is
impossible to tell you all the intrigues I have had to encounter.
I had everybody against me, even the director;
but the papers have spoken much about the base treatment
I have received, and everybody who sees me, even
at a distance, now raises his hat. Thalberg gives a
morning concert in the King&#8217;s Theatre the same day;
but few tickets are sold. He and De Beriot were surprised
at the large sale for my concert.</p></div>

<p>Again, May 24, 1836, he writes:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dearest Félicie, Victoria!!! we have won! I never
had a greater success, hardly so great, as that of last
Saturday night. Wreaths, bouquets, and applause!
Rubini, Tamburini, and Lablache sang, but Grisi did
not sing as promised.<a name="Anchor-6" id="Anchor-6"></a><a href="#Footnote-6" class="Anchor" title="Go to footnote 6.">[6]</a></p>

<p>In spite of all intrigues the journals have pronounced
me one of the first violinists of the world. To&#8211;morrow
I play for the Duke of Devonshire.... I have also
agreed to play for the Philharmonic Society. Fearnley
goes to Christiania Tuesday next. He came to my
concert, and was almost crazy at the <i>furore</i> I made.</p></div>

<p>Two days later, May 26, 1836, he writes:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Yesterday I played for the Duke of Devonshire;
Rubini also sang. The duke said that I had performed
the miracle of endowing the violin with a soul. Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
of the first nobility of England were present, and the
ladies were much moved.</p></div>

<p>The Duke of Devonshire was especially fond
of Rubini, and Ole Bull used to say that he had
never received a more delicate compliment than
that paid him by the duke when he turned to
Rubini and said, as the last tones of the violin
died away: &#8220;You never sang more delightfully,
Rubini!&#8221; Mr. James T. Fields once asked in
what respect Rubini excelled other tenors, to
which Ole Bull replied: &#8220;He began where others
ended.&#8221;</p>

<p>One of the chief triumphs which Ole Bull won
in London, in 1836, was on the occasion of a
Philharmonic concert in which he appeared with
Malibran and Thalberg. So great was his success
that his concerts afterward were crowded,
one audience at the King&#8217;s Theatre numbering
three thousand people, an unprecedented success
that season. He writes in August, 1836:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have just presented some souvenirs of regard to
Rubini, Tamburini, Lablache, and Madame Assandri,
who have assisted me gratuitously in my concerts here.
They are the best people in the world, and immensely
talented. They have told me to command them at all
times, and as often as I please.</p></div>

<p>The following criticisms of his first appearance
in London are taken from the <i>Times</i>, which said,
in its issue of May 23, 1836:&#8212;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. Ole B. Bull, the Norwegian violinist, made his
first public essay in this country, on Saturday evening,
at this theatre [King&#8217;s Theatre]. A more completely
successful performance of the kind we have never attended.
He played three pieces&#8212;a grand concerto in
three movements, allegro, adagio, and rondo; a quartette
for one violin; and a grand warlike Polish movement
introduced by a recitative and adagio. His varieties
of movement seem almost unlimited; and much
as Paganini has done, this artist has certainly opened
a new field on that instrument. His style is essentially
different, and, like that of every truly great master, is
of his own formation. Perhaps his most remarkable
characteristic is the quiet and unpretending manner
in which he produces all his great effects. There
was no trick, no violent gesture, nor any approach to
the <i lang="la">ad captandum</i> school. It seemed so easy, that to
those not acquainted with the mechanical difficulties he
mastered it was not easy to comprehend that anything
extraordinary had been done. In long arpeggio passages
and others made up of rapid and minute divisions,
his bow scarcely seemed to move on the string;
his hand, too, was almost motionless, yet our ear was
charmed with a succession of distinct and sparkling
notes, which kept the whole audience fixed in mute and
almost breathless attention. His command of the instrument,
from the top to the bottom of the scale&#8212;and
he has a scale of his own of three complete octaves
on each string&#8212;is absolutely perfect; in passing from
one extreme of it to the other, however rapidly, he
never missed a note. His tone on the fourth string is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
so beautiful, that even Nicholson&#8217;s flute, when a response
occurred in the accompaniment, was thrown
into the shade. His &#8220;Quartette,&#8221; in the ordinary mode
of playing, would seem impossible; but he distinctly
made out chords of three notes with the bow, and produced
the fourth with his finger. This movement made
such an impression on the audience that an encore was
called for, instead of which Mr. Bull, as a mark of
respect, which he probably thought appropriate, favored
us with our National Anthem. With all our loyalty,
we would have preferred hearing his &#8220;Quartette&#8221; once
more. The applause he received was unbounded, as
little forced, and as sincere, as any we have ever heard
bestowed. Mr. Bull is still a young man, his age not
being more than 26 or 27, and his appearance, on the
whole, prepossessing. The performance of Saturday
was, perhaps, as wonderful for the specimen afforded
of the power of the instrument as for that of the player....
It should be mentioned that the audience included
nearly all the distinguished members of the musical
profession now in town, whose judgment, as they applauded
most cordially, is the proper ordeal of a musical
reputation....</p></div>

<p>The artists appearing with him were Rubini,
Tamburini, and Lablache, with Mdlle. Assandri.</p>

<p>The <i>Times</i> of Thursday, June 2, 1836, referring
to Paganini&#8217;s variations to &#8220;<span lang="it">Nel cor non più mi
sento</span>,&#8221; says:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This air, with variations, is the first instance in
which Ole Bull has challenged a direct comparison with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Paganini, by playing a movement of his composition,
every note of which, as delivered by that great master,
is fresh in the recollection of the musical audiences of
this metropolis. To say that he bore up manfully under
the comparison is sterling praise, and he deserves it.
His arpeggio passages had less tone than Paganini, but
were equal to him in neatness, rapidity, and distinctness;
and in his pizzicato, in alternate use of bow and
finger, difference of effect, if any, was extremely small....
His second performance, on the whole, fully sustains
his reputation....</p></div>

<p>The <i>Times</i> of Thursday, June 16, 1836, remarks:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ole Bull gave his third, announced also as his last,
concert yesterday evening; but it was so good and so
highly successful, that we are quite sure that more
concerts will be called for, and that they must be
granted. A more perfect performance can scarcely
be imagined. To the confidence which, from the first,
Ole Bull possessed in his own resources is now added a
confidence also in the public&#8212;a persuasion that he is
thoroughly understood and estimated, and that conviction
has evidently enabled him to surpass all he hitherto
has done. All pieces which he played last night
were of his own composition, and have been heard
before in public. They were his &#8220;Concerto,&#8221; in which he
introduces his inimitable arpeggios; his &#8220;Adagio Religioso,&#8221;
with the movement describing the &#8220;Lamentation
of a Mother for the loss of her Child;&#8221; his &#8220;<span lang="it">Polacca
Guerriera</span>,&#8221; a most stirring movement, which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
played at the Philharmonic Society; and his &#8220;Fantasia
Solo.&#8221; The great charm, perhaps, consisted in the purity
of style with which the whole was given. It was
all his own&#8212;new, and consistent, and beautiful; not
an atom of charlatanism in it; nor was there any imitation
of any other great master to be detected....</p></div>

<p>Ole Bull now went to Paris, married, as stated
above, and returned with his bride to London.
The little Alexandrine Félicie Villeminot had
developed into a woman of rare beauty. Her
oval face and fine features were thoroughly Parisian,
while the sparkling brilliancy of her large
black eyes betrayed her Spanish blood.</p>

<p>In September a series of musical festivals was
to be given in the cities of York, Manchester,
Birmingham, and Liverpool. The managers
wished to engage Ole Bull, but his demand for
£800 was thought too high. They therefore
opened negotiations with Mesdames Malibran
and Grisi, who asked £2,000. Falling back on
Ole Bull, they came an hour too late. In connection
with Bochsa, the celebrated harpist, he
had engaged a company for a tour in the United
Kingdom.</p>

<p>Nothing remained but to engage Malibran for
the festival. She was not well, but one night in
Manchester she determined to surpass herself.
Singing a duet by Mercadante with Caradori<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Allan, a soprano who held a high trill for a long
time with great effect, Malibran forced a tone two
notes higher, holding it with so much strength
and for so long a time that the audience were
astonished. The desperate effort proved fatal to
the great vocalist. Hemorrhage followed, and resulted
in death a few days later.</p>

<p>The manager had called upon her the day after
the concert, and expressed the hope that she
would soon be well enough to sing again, to
which she replied: &#8220;Do you think me like one of
your English boxers, only to be put on my feet
and go on again with my blows and knocks?
<span lang="fr">Bête!</span>&#8221; She once said to Ole Bull when he tried
to persuade her to guard her health and strength:
&#8220;The public will kill you, either by their neglect
or their exactions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Feeling, as he did, an admiration approaching
idolatry for Malibran, her death was a most painful
shock to him. He writes:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Yesterday the papers announced the death of Malibran.
Poor woman! After having worked so hard for
the public, which was often ungrateful, she dies the
victim of her own success.... I cannot realize it. A
woman gifted with a soul of fire, full of the highest
passion, a ravishing singer, her dramatic talent and
declamation&#8212;ah! I remember how I wept in Bologna
when I saw her as Desdemona in &#8220;Othello.&#8221;</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>But the festival must go on, and the management
sent for Ole Bull to fill Malibran&#8217;s place.
His own concerts had to be postponed, and in
consideration of this and their desire for his services
he was offered £800 for one night in Liverpool,
which he accepted.</p>

<p>But, as Wergeland says, it seemed as if Malibran
had asked a chevalier to cross with her the
river Styx, for he came near sharing her fate.
The hall was large, the orchestral accompaniment
too strong, and his violin could be heard
only when he played <i>fortissimo</i>. In performing
the &#8220;Polacca,&#8221; his exertion was so great that he
burst a blood&#8211;vessel, and his coat had to be cut
from him. The Duke of Devonshire, hearing of
his illness, sent his carriage to fetch him to Chatsworth,
where he spent some quiet days, and recovered
sufficiently to continue his concert tour.</p>

<p>He thus writes of Chatsworth, under date of
October 13, 1836:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Dear Félicie, ... I arrived here Saturday evening,
at nine o&#8217;clock. The duke insisted upon quiet and rest,
that I should be quite at liberty; in short, he is as amiable
and good as possible. But feeling that it would
please him, I took my violin the same evening and
played until midnight, in spite of my intense suffering.
I was obliged the next day to write to Bochsa that I
was so ill that the journey to Brighton would kill me.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>The duke cares for me in a thousand ways, and has absolutely
forbidden me to play. Many of the first aristocracy
of England are here, and I might be taken for
a prince, so much consideration and politeness do I receive.
What magnificence! It is the most splendid
place I know. Since my convalescence, the duke has
shown me all about his domain. We went on foot. I
spoke to him of our marriage.... He asked me if I
had given you the ring which he had presented me, and
wished me to do so.... My health is better, except
that my chest feels worn out, but I hope to be well
soon. How long does the time seem that deprives me
of seeing you! I embrace you very tenderly....</p></div>

<p>At Chatsworth, at the duke&#8217;s town residence,
and at Holland House, he met the famous men
and women of the time. Among them was
Thomas Moore, who not only sang for him his
own songs, but also wrote out and sang for him
the Irish popular melodies and ballads which he
was to use in his concerts.</p>

<p>In sixteen months&#8217; time, Ole Bull gave two
hundred and seventy&#8211;four concerts in the United
Kingdom. His exertions during those years often
threatened to break down his health. He suffered
from nervous attacks and great depression
at such times. His success everywhere, however,
was of the same character which he had achieved
in the capitals, and which has already been told
at length.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>He now decided to visit Germany, and, stopping
<i>en route</i> in Paris, made the acquaintance of
Paganini. His delight at this was so great that
even the recollection of it in later years made
others feel his sensations as he recounted them,
especially his first meeting with the great Italian.
Walking on the Boulevard one morning, he met
Sind, the banker, who had just proposed to introduce
him to Paganini, when they saw in the distance
a strange and striking figure, which could
be no other than that of the great violinist himself.
As they met, he greeted Ole Bull, without
presentation, so familiarly and kindly that the latter
at first thought that he must have been mistaken
for some well&#8211;known friend. But, thrilled
and awed as he was in the presence of the renowned
<i>maestro</i>, he could not help gratefully accepting
his gracious and hearty words. Paganini
insisted upon their returning with him to his
lodgings, and spoke much to Ole Bull of his illness
and troubles, and the persecution of the critics;
in short, he treated him as if he were an old
and confidential friend. The surprise of Sind at
this cordiality may be imagined; but Ole Bull
could only tell him that it was really the first time
he had spoken with Paganini, and hurry away to
live over again in the solitude of his own thoughts
this memorable meeting. He afterwards learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
that Paganini knew more of him and his work
than he supposed, as he spoke familiarly of Ole
Bull&#8217;s performances to others, praising his individuality
of style, and foretelling his brilliant career.
When or where Paganini had heard him
he never found out. The sympathy he felt was
too sensitive to permit him to intrude his own
thoughts upon the master, who was always inclined
to unbosom himself of his troubles to him;
nor could he bring himself to ask the one thing
he most desired&#8212;a sight of the famous violin.</p>

<p>Paganini never had a more observant or critical
listener. Those familiar with the usual rendering
of his compositions must have marked
the difference in Ole Bull&#8217;s performance of them.
He strove to give the fine phrasing, the varied
quality of tone, which he felt himself so fortunate
in having heard from the composer. In Nice, in
1874, Count Cessole, the friend in whose arms
Paganini died, gave Ole Bull a letter to Paganini&#8217;s
son, requesting him to show him the manuscript
of an unpublished concerto of his father&#8217;s,
adding that he was the only person capable of
doing it justice. Unfortunately, the opportunity
of making the journey was denied Ole Bull that
winter, and it never offered itself later.</p>

<p>After leaving Paris concerts were given in
Brussels and Courtray. At the latter place the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
violinist was royally entertained by his host,
Mons. Vermeulen, a passionate lover of music.
A number of the principal citizens met him outside
the town and escorted him to his destination.
His coming was regarded as a <i>fête</i>, and he was
received by the public at his concert with every
expression of delighted admiration. His host
gave him a magnificent banquet, and the citizens
vied with each other in doing him honor.</p>

<p>Learning that Mons. Vermeulen, who was an
amateur collector, was extremely desirous of obtaining
one of his violins, Ole Bull made him
happy by consenting to part with his Guarnerius.
Tarisio, in Paris, supplied its place with another,
a famous instrument, a Joseph Guarnerius labeled
1742, which Ole Bull used as his principal concert
violin for the next twenty&#8211;five or thirty years.
It is now in the possession of his son, Mr. Alexander
Bull.</p>

<p>In December, and January, 1838, Ole Bull gave
six concerts in the Stadt Theatre in Hamburg.
When he left on the 7th of January, a deputation
was sent to ask him to return. His reply, dated
the 9th from Neumünster, stated that his route
would be disarranged by his return, but that he
could not hesitate for a moment as to his pleasure
and duty; so, after one more concert in Neumünster,
he returned to Hamburg and played in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the great Apollo Hall. The large proceeds from
this concert he gave to the charitable institutions
of that city.</p>

<p>An extract from a letter to his wife (from Lübeck,
January 23, 1838), will show how constant
and fatiguing were his labors at this time:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have been traveling and giving concerts every day
without interruption for some time. I have the satisfaction
of feeling that the result was never better. I
played six times in Hamburg (the last time for charity),
and every seat was filled an hour before the concert.
I left in the morning for Kiel, where I arrived early the
next day. I started at once for the rehearsal, although
I had had no sleep during the night, after which I went
to my lodgings, dined, and dressed for the concert.
After the concert I rode in the coach to Schleswig. On
my arrival there in the morning&#8212;rehearsal and then
concert. Left Schleswig about midnight and returned
to Kiel, arriving the following morning, where a rehearsal
and concert awaited me again. I then went to
Neumünster and called on K.&#8217;s uncle.... I was so
weary that I could not help sleeping the whole day.
The next day I played for the poor at Neumünster....</p>

<p>I have bought an English traveling carriage. K.
and I sleep like two kings in it.... We are to start in
a moment, the postilion is impatient. I have to be in
Schwerin to&#8211;night, as I have accepted an invitation from
the court; the princess has promised me a letter of introduction
to her sister, the Empress of Russia.</p>

<p>I have given one concert in Altona, and am to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
two in Lübeck to&#8211;morrow, and two in Schwerin; then
to Rostock, and Königsberg; and, in a month&#8217;s time, I
shall be in St. Petersburg. Wherever I have given
concerts I have played to large audiences and received
double prices....</p>

<p>My dear, be patient! Two months only, and we shall
be reunited.</p></div>

<p>Again, he writes from Berlin, January 31,
1838:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You will undoubtedly have received my letter from
Lübeck some days ago. I came almost against my
will, and quite unexpectedly, to Berlin. It happened in
this way: While in Kiel I received an invitation from
the court of Mecklenburg&#8211;Schwerin (the Princess of
Orleans is a sister of the grand duke), to play there;
and knowing that I intended visiting Russia, the grand
duchess promised me a letter of introduction to her
sister the empress. After writing my last letter to you
in Lübeck I started for Schwerin. Although the distance
is short (we left at one o&#8217;clock in the morning),
we did not arrive there until five o&#8217;clock the next morning,
as we lost our way on account of the heavy snow&#8211;fall.
But that did not tire me much. I lay on furs,
made up comfortably as a bed.</p>

<p>After the rehearsal, and some hours after my arrival,
the grand duke called and thanked me for coming to
Schwerin. One could not meet a more charming person.
At night the court was present. After the performance
the duke came to my dressing&#8211;room with tears
in his eyes. He invited me to the palace the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
morning, and said, &#8220;My wife was much moved
during your whole performance; she <i>must</i> see and talk
with you.&#8221; The next day I had an audience that lasted
three quarters of an hour.... The duchess told me
she had just written to her father, the King of Prussia,
of the sensation I had made, and asked me to go to
Berlin and play there, suggesting that it might be of
benefit to me in Russia.... She asked me what she
could do for me.... Her husband was also exceedingly
kind. After the concert I was awakened by a
serenade. The next day the ducal family attended
the rehearsal; in the evening the duchess gave me
letters to Berlin and Russia, and at the conclusion of
the performance the orchestra presented me with a
laurel wreath.</p></div>

<p>He went to Berlin and made his visit to the
intendant, who was offensively patronizing, and
appointed an hour the day following for another
call at the Opera House. Ole Bull came.
&#8220;Where is your violin?&#8221; &#8220;In the case.&#8221; &#8220;And
where is the case?&#8221; &#8220;At the hotel.&#8221; &#8220;But
did I not ask you to play for me?&#8221; &#8220;Excuse
me, sir, I could not think you were in earnest.
I play either for honor or for money, and in
this case neither is in question.&#8221; &#8220;But it is impossible
for me to present you to his majesty
without having heard you.&#8221; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>&#8220;If the request of
the grand duchess is not a sufficient recommendation
to his majesty her father, I am quite content
to leave the city,&#8221;&#8212;and he did leave Berlin
at once.</p>

<p>He next gave four concerts in four days in
Königsberg, and, being crowned with laurel,
which he tried to decline, he responded by playing
&#8220;<span lang="de">Heil dir ein Siegenkranz</span>.&#8221; In Riga he gave
four concerts in five days. In St. Petersburg he
had some difficulties to encounter with another
intendant; but shortly after his arrival he played
at the Imperial Theatre. The empress, the imperial
family, and the court, were present. On
his entrance he was warmly received, and the
&#8220;<span lang="it">Polacca Guerriera</span>&#8221; created the greatest enthusiasm.
The applause constantly interrupted the
orchestra, and the musicians were obliged to wait
patiently the pleasure of the audience. This applause
Ole Bull acknowledged, when called before
the curtain, by playing the Russian National
Hymn. This created another furor, and he was
recalled again and again, the applause being led
by the imperial family. A critic wrote:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I never witnessed such a universal ovation; Ole Bull&#8217;s
tones have the power of melting the hearts even of the
envious. When he commenced, he played to both enemies
and friends, but he ended by playing to friends
only. He has, by his personal worth, made himself
universally beloved here.</p></div>

<p>He gave three concerts in the Great Theatre to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
crowded houses, although the usual prices were
quadrupled. He played also in private for the
empress, who presented him with a ring&#8212;an
emerald in a setting of one hundred and forty
diamonds. The emperor sent him an autograph
letter. Being invited to Moscow he gave five
concerts there, and received many jewels from
the nobility of the city, among them a valuable
ring from the Princess Galizin.</p>

<p>Here the sad tidings of his father&#8217;s death
reached him. He writes:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A letter from my brother Edward describes most
touchingly my poor father&#8217;s death! He says he spoke
often of the anticipated delight of his dear Ole&#8217;s return,
after so many years of separation. He read all
the poems and criticisms, and knew that I was on my
way home, with my dear Félicie. He constantly heard
divine music that made him forget his sufferings.
When dying, he spoke of me, and his face was beautiful
to behold.</p>

<p>I am so sad! Such fears! Ever the thought haunts
me that I may not see you and our child again....</p>

<p>To&#8211;morrow I play a quartette of Beethoven&#8217;s, a quartette
of Mozart&#8217;s, a quintette of Gebel&#8217;s, and a composition
of my own.... God protect you both!</p></div>

<p>His grand concerts in St. Petersburg were
given in a hall that would seat five thousand
people, and it was filled at every performance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>He now went through Finland, giving concerts
in the chief towns, and thence to Stockholm.
Being in haste to reach home, he resolved not to
give any concert there. It was hoped, however,
that he might be induced to change his mind
by inviting him to play for the benefit of the sufferers
from the fire in Wermeland, some of whom
were then in Stockholm collecting subscriptions.
He presented five hundred dollars to the sufferers,
but declined to play. His presence at the
palace was requested, and the king, during the
interview, asked him to remain and play, saying
that he made the request as King of Norway.
He could not well refuse to comply with a request
so put, and, notwithstanding his anxiety to
hurry home, he consented to give five concerts,
the last of which netted five thousand dollars.
He played at the palace twice. The &#8220;<span lang="it">Polacca
Guerriera</span>&#8221; so moved the old warrior king, to
whose ears martial music was ever the sweetest,
that he rose from his seat, and remained standing
until the piece was finished.</p>

<p>The following incident occurred during Ole
Bull&#8217;s first audience with Bernadotte. The king
remarked that he had written to the Emperor of
Russia, that he, too, had his Poles, the Norwegians;
probably forgetting, for the moment, the
nationality of his listener. Ole Bull replied with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
warmth: &#8220;Can your majesty mention a single instance
in which my countrymen have not proved
themselves law&#8211;abiding and loyal subjects?&#8221;
&#8220;Your remark, sir, is out of place.&#8221; &#8220;If my remark
is out of place, your majesty, I myself am
out of place, and will take my leave.&#8221; &#8220;Remain,
sir!&#8221; cried Bernadotte, extending his hand with a
commanding gesture. &#8220;No, sire! I will see if a
<i>Norseman</i> is free in the palace of the King of
Sweden!&#8221; and the artist bowed low as he retired.
Instantly the cloud lifted, and, with a winning
smile and courteous words, the king said, &#8220;I pray
you, sir, to remain; it is the duty of a prince to
hear the opinions of all his people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before Ole Bull left, Bernadotte offered him
the Vasa order, which he declined, saying that a
handkerchief or a button from his majesty&#8217;s coat
would be a precious memento of this visit. When
the king found that both order and jewels were
firmly declined, in parting with Ole Bull he told
him that at all times he would be admitted directly
to his presence, and concluded, &#8220;You will
not refuse an old man&#8217;s blessing&#8221;&#8212;which the
violinist knelt to receive.</p>

<p>The order in brilliants was sent later to Ole
Bull in Christiania, through his friend, Count
Wedel&#8211;Jarlsberg, with a message from the king
requesting the artist to accept the gift, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
world might know his king appreciated and honored
genius.</p>

<p>The artist arrived with his family in Christiania,
the capital of Norway, July 8, 1838, having gone
directly there from Stockholm. The people were
impatient to hear him, but he felt it necessary to
take a fortnight&#8217;s rest after his long and fatiguing
journey. The students hastened meantime to
greet him before his public appearance, and on
the 19th of July a dinner was given him by the
foremost men of the country. Poems were written
and read, his portrait was wreathed in flowers,
and he himself was at last crowned with laurel.
Wergeland says of his arrival and concert:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Business even was dull while awaiting him. The
talk was only of Ole Bull. The people had evidently
thought of him as walking about with diamond buttons
on his coat and surrounded by a sort of triumphal halo;
and it was a surprise when he at last stood before us,
exactly the same as of old, the same modest, unassuming
man, with the same kindly smile and the piercing
glance. Before his concert he made a visit to his old
teacher, Paulsen, who had been unfortunate and now
lay upon a sick&#8211;bed. He played for him until the old
man was happy, and when he left he took care to insure
his permanent comfort.</p></div>

<p>Of the first concert it is enough to say that the
great expectations of the people were not disappointed.
Wergeland continues:&#8212;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The greatest marvel of all was that he brought Norway
home to the Norsemen. Most people knew the
folk&#8211;songs and dances, but were ashamed to admire
them. Lifted by him into their confidence and love,
these homely melodies suddenly began to gleam like
stars, and the people came to feel that they too had
jewels of their own.</p></div>

<p>Ole Bull&#8217;s name was now known in every part
of Norway. Among the strangers who came to
Christiania to hear him was the giant, the engineer
Engebret Soot. Wild and passionate as
he was, music could subdue him like a child, and
his family used to resort to this means of taming
his Berserk nature. He had taken a short respite
from his work and gone as fast as possible by
carriole to Christiania, but arrived only at night
after Ole Bull, weary from the first concert and
its triumphs, had fallen fast asleep.</p>

<p>There is a knocking at his door, which, repeated,
is at last answered: &#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221;
The door is already opened. &#8220;Good evening,
Ole Bull! It is I&#8212;Engebret Soot. I am come
too late for your concert, and I want you to get
up and play for me now.&#8221; &#8220;I am really too tired.
I&#8212;it is impossible,&#8212;besides&#8221;&#8212; But by the
light of a candle which his unexpected visitor has
succeeded in finding and lighting, the violinist
sees before him a man of giant size grandly proportioned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
&#8220;I have traveled ninety miles to&#8211;day
to hear you.&#8221; &#8220;Yes, but to&#8211;morrow&#8221;&#8212; &#8220;I must
be in Aremark. You <i>must</i> play for me now, Ole
Bull.&#8221;</p>

<p>They exchange looks; they are physically the
two best developed men in Norway; they understand
each other, and Ole Bull takes his violin.
Sitting on the edge of the bed he plays and, in
his turn, subdues and controls his formidable
friend, moving him at will to tears or laughter;
but he himself is not permitted to sleep until he
has given his one auditor more than the audience
of the evening had heard.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful of the Norwegian
poems addressed to Ole Bull was written by the
famous poet Welhaven under the following circumstances.
Crushed by the death of his betrothed
he was leading a life of entire seclusion,
and his friends were fearful that his depression
would seriously affect his mind. He was persuaded
to hear Ole Bull; the music brought him
the relief of tears, and moved him to write this
grateful tribute to his friend.<a name="Anchor-7" id="Anchor-7"></a><a href="#Footnote-7" class="Anchor" title="Go to footnote 7.">[7]</a></p>

<p>At the request of deputations Ole Bull now
gave concerts in the principal towns along the
coast and in Bergen. The people of his native
city received him warmly, and festivities in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
honor were the order of the day. During his
visit there he composed &#8220;The Mountains of Norway,&#8221;
the last piece played by him at his last concert
in 1880. He received everywhere proofs of
the fervent sympathy and affection of his own
people. At his farewell concert in Bergen he
was greeted with a very rain of flowers by the
ladies, although the season was so far advanced
that these were grown in their houses and not in
their gardens.</p>

<p>In October, 1838, he left Norway for his third
continental tour. He gave five concerts in Copenhagen,
one of which was for the founding of a
pension fund for the chorus of the Royal Opera.
He was presented at court, and played for King
Frederic, who gave him a gold snuff&#8211;box set with
diamonds, saying, &#8220;As you have won the hearts
of my people, it is fitting that I should present
you the key to my kingdom.&#8221; On the cover of
the box was a picture in enamel of the fortress
by which the harbor of Copenhagen is defended.</p>

<p>The following letter from Hans Christian Andersen
will be of interest here:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="letterhead">
<span class="smcap">Copenhagen</span>, <i>December 8, 1838</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear good Friend</span>,&#8212;At this moment you are
in my birthplace! I must bid you welcome there, and
once more chat with you. It is only some days since
we first met, but there are natures that need no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
time to become dear to each other, and ours, I think,
are of them.</p>

<p>Thanks for the lyric strains of your violin,&#8212;if they
could be rendered in words we should have a wonderful
cycle of poems. Although you played to the world at
large, and many felt deeply what a human heart spoke
to them in melody, I was egotistic enough&#8212;or perhaps
you will give my feeling a nobler name&#8212;to imagine
and dream that it was singing for me alone; that I
alone heard you tell in fragments the story of your artist
life through your tones! Ah! long before I heard
you, I had felt an interest in your genial personality;
but now that we have met face to face, seen and understood
each other, that sentiment has become friendship.
I feel it will be a pleasure to know that you have won a
soul; therefore I tell you, and am not ashamed. Every&#8211;day
people would not understand me, and they would
smile at this epistle, but I do not write to them in this
strain&#8212;only to the friend Ole Bull.</p>

<p>One of these days I shall call on your uncle to see
the dear little Ole,<a name="Anchor-8" id="Anchor-8"></a><a href="#Footnote-8" class="Anchor" title="Go to footnote 8.">[8]</a> kiss him, and think of his father
and mother. The poor <i>bonne</i>, so suddenly dropped
down in this corner of Europe, must be lonely. I send
your lovely wife a whole bouquet of compliments. She
cannot have forgotten me altogether&#8212;because of my
wretched French, if for no other reason. Yesterday I
dined with Thorwaldsen. We spoke of you, and when
I told him that I should write to you, he asked to be
remembered. He had tried to find you at the Hotel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
d&#8217;Angleterre, but they told him incorrectly, it seems,
that you had gone to Roskilde, and he did not succeed
in seeing you.</p>

<p>What an agreeable surprise would a few lines be from
you! Ah, do let me know how your own bodily self is
thriving. You were not well when we said good&#8211;by&#8212;write
of yourself. But do so at once, while the feeling
is warm; later&#8212;well, I fear that if you do not, others
will absorb your time, and that you will <i>not</i> write. Send
at least a few words&#8212;and now, God bless you! May
you have all the success and happiness you deserve!
Your name has a pleasant sound in Europe, your heart
is known to your friends. I have many greetings for
you from the C.&#8217;s, where I make my home. The <i>spirituelle</i>
daughters think a great deal of you; they said
they hardly knew you well enough to ask to be remembered,
but why should I not tell you what must always
be dear to you? Much, much love to you. Farewell!
with fraternal heart. Yours,</p>

<p>By way of Odense, Flensborg, Schleswig, and
Kiel, Ole Bull went to Hamburg, where he appeared
three times; then to Bremen, Brunswick,
and Hanover. He also went to Cassel, having
received an invitation from the prince and Spohr,
who now received him in the most kindly manner,
and seemed anxious by his cordiality to blot
out all memory of their former meeting. The
following letter will show their friendly relations

<p>Ole Bull gave two concerts to crowded houses
in Cassel, and then went to Berlin. There were
some difficulties in making terms for the theatre
here, the king himself being proprietor and supreme
manager. The musicians, moreover, were
not favorable to Ole Bull, because of certain one&#8211;sided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
reports of an intrigue against him in Stockholm,
which he had wholly overcome, and which
had resulted in making him more popular in
Sweden than ever. Last of all came the attack
of the critic Finck. When Ole Bull played in
Berlin Herr Finck was ill, and unable to attend
the concert. He sent and asked the artist to visit
him. He went and played for him, and also explained
his method, and the changes he had made
in his bow. Shortly after he left Berlin the criticism
appeared in the <i>Leipsic Musical Gazette</i>.
Herr Finck said that the technique of the artist
was indeed astonishing, and that he was not lacking
in certain points in his execution, as some
had said. He found his tone absolutely pure, and
his staccato, pizzicato, etc., marvelous and incomparable,
but claimed that his art, when before the
public, was artifice, a kind of astounding legerdemain.
His chief attack was directed against his
compositions. It might well have been thought
a criticism against Paganini revived, so similar
was it to the charges made against that violinist.</p>

<p>Mendelssohn wrote to his sister Rebecca, from
Berlin, February 15, 1844, as follows:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The musical public here are just like Finck, editor of
the old <i>Musical Gazette</i>; they are capital at finding out
the weak points of what is good, and discovering merit
in mediocrity, which annoys me more than anything.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of the animadversions of the critic,
the public crowded the concerts of Ole Bull,
whose only answer was through his violin. He
traveled closely on the heels of the celebrated
violinist, Lapinsky, the idol of the <i>Musical Gazette</i>.
Whenever they met, Lapinsky was sorely defeated,
and at last he determined to keep altogether out
of Ole Bull&#8217;s way. The latter next gave five
concerts in Breslau, and sixteen in Vienna. His
rendering of the clarionet adagio in Mozart&#8217;s
&#8220;Quartette in D flat, transcribed for Violin,&#8221; was
so much admired, that he was obliged to repeat
it at all his concerts in Vienna.</p>

<p>Not a note of the score was changed, and the
reverence for Mozart, revealed in his performance,
made a very deep impression. It may be
remarked here that those who have made the
masterpieces of Mozart the study of a life&#8211;time,
who have edited his works, and dwelt upon the
perfection of their instrumentation, have also said
that Ole Bull&#8217;s rendering of these, especially of
the adagios, showed a deeper, more appreciative
understanding of them than had ever been attained
before by any instrumentalist. Ole Bull
used to say that Mozart was his religion. To
him, there could be no more beautiful, no loftier
expression of human thought and aspiration than
he found in the works of that master. He felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
that no mortal could write Mozart&#8217;s &#8220;Requiem&#8221;
and live.</p>

<p>From Vienna Ole Bull went to Hungary, giving
concerts in Pesth, Raab, and Presburg. He
purchased a rare violin in Pesth labeled &#8220;<span lang="la">Antonius
Stradivarius Cremonesius faciebat, anno
1687</span>.&#8221; This instrument was unique, being the
only one which the master had inlaid with ebony
and ivory. It had been made to order for Philip
the Sixth of Spain, and remained in the possession
of the Kings of Spain until the reign of
Charles the Fourth, when it was stolen by the
French. Ole Bull bought it of Herr Rorats, an
amateur, who had purchased it because of its
beautiful appearance, its tone not recommending
it. But in Ole Bull&#8217;s hands its noble and pure
tone was soon restored.</p>

<p>He returned again to Vienna, giving five concerts
to full houses. A critic remarked that his
&#8220;Norway&#8217;s Mountains&#8221; and his playing of Mozart
had conciliated his few obstinate opponents, and
united all voices in his praise.</p>

<p>From Linz he went to Salzburg, the home of
Mozart. He had the honor of proposing and
giving the first concert for the Mozart fund, and
the great satisfaction of having the wife of Mozart
present at the performance.</p>

<p>Being engaged in Paris for January, 1839, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
concerts at the Grand Opéra, he hastened there
via Munich, Baden&#8211;Baden, and Strasburg, giving
concerts in these places.</p>

<p>He returned to Germany soon after, giving one
concert in Carlsruhe and two in Stuttgart. The
King of Wurtemberg gave him a ring set in brilliants.
He also visited Cassel again, where two
concerts were given with great success; also others
in Augsburg, Bonn, Mannheim, Landau, Carlsruhe,
and Heidelberg, after which he returned to
Paris in the autumn of 1839.</p>

<p>A few extracts from letters to his wife, during
this season of 1839, may be added here:&#8212;</p>

<p>Instead of arriving at five o&#8217;clock we did not reach
this place until eight; the driver got asleep on his seat
and fell down under the carriage wheels; the horses
ran against a post, breaking the carriage, and finally got
away, giving us a good deal of trouble to catch them.
The weather is fine, and I have taken fresh horses in
order to reach Raab this evening. To&#8211;morrow morning
I shall reach Pesth.... The surrounding country here
is most beautiful and the journey very interesting, many
of the old monuments being well preserved....</p></div>

<p>I arrived in Pesth yesterday evening: it seems that I

in Comorn for the steamer to Pesth, visiting the wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
fortifications there.... I wanted a distraction
from my suffering, God knows how much I have suffered!
I still hope and work, not for myself, for you,
my family, my country, my Norway, of which I am
proud. Why should I dwell upon my sad thoughts?
You indeed have more than enough yourself. You
share with me the memory of our little Ole<a name="Anchor-9" id="Anchor-9"></a><a href="#Footnote-9" class="Anchor" title="Go to footnote 9.">[9]</a> waiting

<p>I have so much to tell you I don&#8217;t know where to
begin. Mozart&#8217;s widow was invited to Munich by the
king to hear the opera of &#8220;Don Giovanni&#8221; performed.
She and her sister made me a visit, and she invited me
to sit with her in her box, that we might hear the opera
together. The director has been working against me,
because I went the evening after my second concert to a
festival given by the artists in honor of the celebrated
Schwanthaler the sculptor, who now rivals Thorwaldsen,
and played two pieces. Germany&#8217;s most gifted
artists gave me their loudest plaudits, but the director,
having been recently decorated by the king, thought I
ought to have limited my performance to his establishment.
He visited Madame Mozart in her box, turning
his back upon me the whole time. I afterwards told
him my candid opinion of his behavior, and added that
I would play no more in his theatre.</p>

<p>The artists and their wives made an entertainment
for me later, and as they regretted they were not to
hear me more, I played for them. I also played at the
house of the celebrated painter Cornelius. The <i>literati</i>
of Munich were present, and it was a great honor and
delight to me to be able to hold the attention of these
men; but some of the aristocracy are not pleased with
me, and think I have not bowed sufficiently low to the
powers that be. Day after to&#8211;morrow I give my first
concert in Augsburg, and hope to give a second one.
I am very anxious about you....</p></div>

<p>Having received word of the birth of a second
son, he writes from Augsburg, November 16,
1839:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My dear, think of my surprise and delight when I
received the happy news! Let us praise God for his
goodness to us, and let us hope that He will preserve
our son to us! I write a large hand that your eyes may
not be tried. I received a letter yesterday from Dr.
Dufours, just before my concert, but was so moved that
I could not write. I had to go out and walk, to catch
my breath. Be careful, my dearest friend. You must
not worry or be disturbed, for both your dear sakes.
Dr. Dufours is a rare man, and I am proud to call him
my friend. So much self&#8211;denial, frankness, and honesty,
allied to such force of character and originality,
are gifts seldom to be found united in one person. Tell
him how grateful I am to him, and that I can hardly
wait until my return to Paris to express my thanks.</p>

<p>I give one more concert here on Saturday, and then
go to Stuttgart....</p></div>

<p>Your last letter has given me the greatest joy, but I
fear you are not prudent enough.... I arrived here
last evening; concert next Tuesday. A warm invitation
from Nuremberg and Frankfort. My route will be
as follows: Nuremberg, Würzburg, Frankfort, Darmstadt,
Mannheim, Heidelberg, Carlsruhe, Strasburg, and
Paris. In Augsburg I received an invitation from the
Queen Dowager of Bavaria to return to Munich. I
played for her, and her manner at parting was most cordial.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
She gave me a pin set with brilliants as a souvenir
of the visit....</p></div>

<p>Now I am a moment alone! ... the whole day long
one continuous reception of visitors! I dined with an
old friend from Paris, Hiller, the composer....</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="letterhead">
<i>December 7, 1839.</i>
</p>

<p>You will find many alterations in the finale of my
Bravura Variations. I have still much to do as regards
my compositions themselves, and my playing of them,
before they are satisfactory to me. I find every day
that there are improvements possible, and grave errors
to be corrected, but I have a firm will, and am trying to
do better and better. It is very fortunate that none of
my compositions are published; I shall take good care
not to have this done for some time.... I bought a
fine Nicolaus Amati in Nuremberg, very much like the
one I left in London.... Its tone thrills me. Vuillaume
will be astonished at its beauty. He must put it
in order for me according to my own method. Should
it compare favorably with my large Guarnerius, it will
be well worth the eighty louis d&#8217;or that I paid for it.
This would be a high price for an Amati of ordinary
size, but the large form increased its value.</p></div>

<p>I have so much to attend to that I have no time to
eat or sleep except when in my traveling carriage, and
you know that does not give real rest when over&#8211;fatigued
from concerts....</p>

<p>I must correspond with the directors of the theatres;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
must obtain information regarding the people with
whom I am to deal; I must make my appointments for
concerts and rehearsals, have my music copied, correct
the scores, compose, play, and travel nights. I am always
cheated, and in everlasting trouble. I reproach
myself when everything does not turn out for the best,
and am consumed with grief. I really believe I should
succumb to all these demands and fatigues if it were not
for my drinking cold water and bathing in it every
morning and evening.</p></div>

<p>The detailed account that has been given of
the years 1836&#8211;1839, may afford the reader an insight
into the life of the artist, his struggles, his
labors, his inspiration, and his reward. Many,
indeed most, of the seriously disheartening experiences
which Ole Bull suffered, were the
results of his lack of early training. No inexperienced
woman could be more fearful of
asking or accepting securities for business obligations
lest it should be considered a lack of confidence
on his part. He made no attempt to
order his business in detail, but left to others
what he could have readily mastered, always waiting
for results to justify the enterprise; and this
dependence was an unfortunate habit for a generous,
sensitive, trustful man. It made him too
unjustly suspicious after painful experiences. He
was apt, when he found himself unfairly treated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
to break off a business relation, without regard to
the consequences, and thus often exposed himself
to much annoyance and trouble.</p>

<p>His anger had no taint of narrow vindictiveness
or revenge, but often served to free him from
the toils of others. Then they might find him
on the vantage ground of work or influence, to
which his ready resources had led him, and where
they could not follow him. He was not suspicious
by nature, and lent too ready an ear to the
suggestions or pretensions of others; his sympathetic
nature and his needs making him an easy
victim for designing persons, and giving rise to
his chief troubles. Curiously enough, those who
had grossly betrayed his confidence often found
that they could not do without the charm of his
presence after once having known it, however
they might disregard his interests and happiness;
and they knew that he could not but be generous
to a vanquished foe. He used to say, &#8220;I will not,
because one man has failed me, expect the like
of another, until it comes.&#8221; His trust in the good
impulses of human nature never failed him long.
Leaving home at the age of seventeen, wholly untrained
in practical affairs, he worked out many
a problem of life, as of art, at the hardest&#8212;through
bitter experience in poverty and tears;
but the ideals and aspirations of his youth were
those of his age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>On his return to Paris, in the winter of 1839,
his engagement at the Grand Opéra was broken
up, through an intrigue of Schlesinger, the publisher
of <i lang="fr">La Revue Musicale</i>, and he gave a few
concerts at the Théâtre de la Renaissance. In
the spring of 1840 he went to London, taking
Mr. Morandi, a harpist, as his secretary; but finding
him unreliable in some respects, he determined
to break loose from the connection at the
risk of losing twelve hundred francs, which he
had already advanced to Morandi. The latter,
knowing that he could hold him on his contract,
acted accordingly.</p>

<p>One day when Ole Bull was playing with
Franz Liszt, in the latter&#8217;s room, the manager of
the hotel was announced, who told Ole Bull that
a policeman was outside with a warrant obtained
by Morandi, and that the latter himself was standing
at the corner of the street to watch the arrest.
The artist spent a pleasant afternoon and evening
with Liszt, and returned quietly to his own
hotel at midnight, the officer and Morandi having
meanwhile become tired of watching for him.
The following day he went to his ambassador,
Count Bjornstjerna, and Morandi&#8217;s lawyer was
sent for, who demanded sixty pounds, for breach
of contract. Ole Bull was indignant, and refused
to pay a penny; but what was to be done? It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
was two o&#8217;clock. At three he was to play at
St. James for the queen, and at the corner of
the street two policemen were waiting with the
warrant for his arrest, if the claim of the lawyer
should not be conceded. A cab was summoned,
and one of Count Bjornstjerna&#8217;s footmen, wrapped
in Ole Bull&#8217;s cloak, entered the vehicle and moved
rapidly off, followed by the policemen; while five
minutes later, the artist himself was driven quietly
to the palace, in the count&#8217;s carriage. In the
evening the matter was compromised, Ole Bull
paying twenty pounds, in addition to the twelve
hundred francs already advanced.</p>

<p>In a letter to his wife, dated in London, May
15, 1840, he writes of Liszt as follows:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have not spoken to you of Franz Liszt, with whom
I have formed the warmest friendship in a very short
time. We have played together and are mutually inspired
with admiration and sympathy for each other.
You will make his acquaintance....</p></div>

<p>Ole Bull used to tell an amusing incident concerning
Liszt and himself. They had played a
good deal together, often giving concerts without
the aid of a manager. On one occasion when a
manager had been employed, and many distinguished
artists appeared, Ole Bull had been advertised
with special prominence as the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>&#8220;eminent&#8221;
violinist, but did not know of this. On
going to his friend&#8217;s somewhat late to supper,
Liszt remarked, in a cutting tone, &#8220;Ah, our <i>eminent</i>
friend has arrived!&#8221; Ole Bull saw that the
feeling of the company was not cordial, and that
Liszt had only been the spokesman of their discontent.
At last he arose and said: &#8220;I do not
understand the drift of your conversation, but
can readily see that my presence is not agreeable.
I am pained in proportion as I have entertained
the warmest admiration and friendship
for you, Monsieur Liszt;&#8221; and he courteously
took his leave. As he was walking rapidly away
he heard his name shouted two or three times
on the street, and, turning, saw Liszt running
after him, hatless, and waving his napkin as he
shouted, &#8220;My good friend, there must be some
mistake. I beg you to come back, and let us discover
who has played us this trick.&#8221; He then
explained the cause of their irritation, and Ole
Bull, in his turn, made it clear that he was not responsible
for the offense. Cordiality was at once
restored, and Liszt was the life of the evening.
At its close he insisted that the company should
breakfast with him the next morning. The invitation
was accepted, and, after the breakfast and
many pleasant topics had been discussed, Liszt
suddenly turned to the manager, who was present,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and said: &#8220;We have decided to have a trial.
I am to be judge, and you shall be permitted to
answer, if you can, the charges brought against
you as to that announcement of yesterday.&#8221; After
an examination and cross&#8211;examination, in which
the man denied all responsibility in the matter,
the judge pronounced sentence solemnly: &#8220;Ole
Bull, I charge you to take this man, and hold him
at arm&#8217;s length out of the window&#8221;&#8212;they were
in the third story&#8212;&#8220;until he do confess.&#8221; So
said, so done; and, dangling over the street, the
man did confess a plot to breed jealousy and ill&#8211;will,
in order to break up a combination of two
names which, as already stated, had sometimes
made the services of an <i>impressario</i> unnecessary.
The torment of the culprit was heightened by an
occasional query on the part of Ole Bull if he
was not soon to be relieved, as his arms were too
tired to hold out much longer; but Liszt kept the
poor wretch hanging there until the last moment,
when he released him only on the promise that
he would never offend again.</p>

<p>During this season, Liszt and Ole Bull played
the Beethoven &#8220;Kreutzer Sonata,&#8221; at one of the
Philharmonic Concerts. There was a great diversity
of opinion among the critics as to the
performance. The Philharmonic Society themselves
gave expression to their judgment by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
presentation of a piece of silver plate to the violinist.</p>

<p>The following note from Liszt is a pleasant reminder
of the engagements of that time:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot" lang="fr">

<p><span class="smcap">Mon cher Ole</span>,&#8212;Arrivé hier à 3 heures; concert
à 8 heures et demi. Leurs altesses le grand Duc de
Bade et le prince de S. l&#8217;ont honoré de leur presence.
Du reste assemblée très&#8211;choisie, aristocratique&#8212;mais
non pas très&#8211;nombreuse.</p>

<p>Benazet pourtant m&#8217;a assuré qu&#8217;il y avait là toute la
bonne compagnie de Baden.</p>

<p>D&#8217;apres cette épreuve, et quelques conversations, je
crois pouvoir dire que vous ferez surement un ou deux
bons concerts ici, et je vous engage beaucoup à ne pas
rester d&#8217;avantage dans les environs sans vous faire entendre
ici.</p>

<p>Mardi prochain je donnerai mon 2[<sup>m</sup>e] concert. Mercredi
je partirai pour Mayence où mon concert est annoncé
pour le lendemain, et vendredi je compte être à
Ems.</p>

<p>Ce que vous auriez donc, à ce qu&#8217;il me semble, de
meilleur à faire, ce serait de venir ici lundi ou mardi, de
jouer votre concert dans la semaine (peut&#8211;être jeudi
ou samedi); et ensuite de repartir pour Ems, où je vous
annoncerai de mon mieux.</p>

<p>À revoir donc, probablement bientôt, mon cher prodigieux
artiste; gardez&#8211;moi votre bonne amitié et
comptez bien sur toute la mienne.</p>

<p class="quotsig">
Tout à vous d&#8217;admiration et de sympathie,<br />
<span class="smcap">F. Liszt</span>.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot" lang="fr">

<p>Soyez assez bon pour faire mes plus affectueux compliments
à M. Heinefetter et priez&#8211;le de ne pas annoncer
mon concert pour lundi ainsi que nous en
étions convenus. Lors de mon passage à Mannheim
(mercredi soir) j&#8217;aurai soin de l&#8217;informer du jour que
nous puissons choisir. Si par le plus grand des hazards
on pouvait m&#8217;annoncer un concert mercredi, je crois
que je pourrai être à temps à Mannheim&#8212;mais il vaut
mieux, je crois, ne pas forcer ainsi la chose. En tout
cas n&#8217;oubliez pas de prevenir Heinefetter que lundi il
me sera impossible de tenir ma promesse.</p></div>

<p>Ole Bull now went over to Brussels, where he
had a warm friend in Monsieur Fétis; thence
to Antwerp, the Rhine towns, and Heidelberg,
joining company with Liszt. He then returned
to Paris, but was soon called to Berlin, where he
had been specially invited to participate in the
festivities of the coronation of King William (the
present Emperor of Germany). He gave six concerts
to the royal family and their visitors. In
Leipsic he also gave six concerts, where the musical
society, &#8220;Der Tunnel,&#8221; presented him with
a silver vase, surmounted by a figure of Apollo
with the lyre.</p>

<p>It was in Leipsic that the Cellini Caspar da
Salo violin came to him. Mendelssohn and Liszt
were dining with Ole Bull, when a servant placed
by his master&#8217;s plate an envelope bearing a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
seal. &#8220;Open your letter, Ole Bull! it may be
important,&#8221; said Liszt. It was from the son of
Rhaczek, the owner of the violin, and imparted
the news of his father&#8217;s death, adding that a
clause of his will directed that the instrument
should be offered to Ole Bull. Delighted, he
told the news to his friends, who, when they
learned the value set upon the violin, advised him
to be cautious as to its purchase. &#8220;If it is really
worth the price you mean to pay for it,&#8221; said
Mendelssohn, &#8220;we must dedicate it together by
playing the &#8216;Kreutzer.&#8217;&#8221; When it came, and had
been put in order, Mendelssohn&#8217;s suggestion was
carried out. He and Ole Bull played Beethoven&#8217;s
&#8220;Sonata,&#8221; which was the first work performed on
that wonderful instrument. The following description
of the violin, by Mrs. Childs, is entirely
faithful and correct:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The violin, now in possession of Ole Bull, was made
to the order of Cardinal Aldobrandini, one of a noble
family at Rome memorable for their patronage of the
fine arts. He gave for it 3,000 Neapolitan ducats, and
presented it to the treasury of Innsprück, where it became
a celebrated curiosity, under the name of &#8220;The
Treasury&#8211;Chamber Violin.&#8221; When that city was taken
by the French, in 1809, it was carried to Vienna, and
sold to Rhaczek, a wealthy Bohemian, whose splendid
collection of rare and ancient stringed instruments had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
attracted universal attention in the musical world. The
gem of his museum was the violin manufactured by Da
Salo, and sculptured by Cellini. He was offered immense
sums for it by English, Russian, and Polish noblemen,
but to all such offers he answered, &#8220;Not for the
price of half Vienna.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few years ago Ole Bull gave some fifteen concerts
in Vienna, with the brilliant success which usually attends
him. The Bohemian, who went with the crowd
to hear him, was an enthusiastic admirer of his genius,
and soon became personally acquainted with him.
Until then he had considered himself the most learned
man in Europe in the history of violins, the peculiar
merits of all the most approved manufacturers, and the
best methods of repairing deficiencies, or improving the
tones. But with Ole Bull, love of the violin had been
an absorbing passion from his earliest childhood. He
never saw one of a novel shape, or heard one with a
new tone, without studying into the causes of the tone,
and the effects produced by the shape. Through every
nook and corner of Italy he sought for new varieties of
his favorite instrument, as eagerly as an Oriental merchant
seeks for rare pearls. He had tried all manner of
experiments; he knew at sight the tuneful qualities of
every species of wood, and precisely how the slightest
angle or curve in the fashion of an instrument would
affect the sound. He imparted to the Bohemian amateur
much information that was new and valuable; and
this sympathy of tastes and pursuits produced a warm
friendship between them. Of course, Ole looked with
a longing eye on the oldest and best of his violins;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
but the musical antiquarian loved it like an only child.
He could not bring himself to sell it at that time, but
he promised that, if he ever did part with it, the minstrel
of Norway should have the preference over every
other man in the world. He died two years afterward,
and a letter from his son informed Ole Bull that his
dying father remembered the promise he had given.
He purchased it forthwith, and it was sent to him at
Leipsic.</p>

<p>On the head of this curious violin is carved and
colored an angel&#8217;s face, surrounded by flowing curls of
hair. Behind this figure, leaning against the shoulders,
is a very beautiful little mermaid, the human form of
which terminates in scales of green and gold. The neck
of the instrument is ornamented with arabesques in
blue, red, and gold. Below the bridge is a mermaid in
bronze. Thorwaldsen took great delight in examining
these figures, and bestowed enthusiastic praise on the
gracefulness of the design, and the excellence of the
workmanship. Ole Bull was born in February, and, by
an odd coincidence, the bridge of his darling violin is
delicately carved with two intertwining fishes, like the
zodiacal sign of February. Two little Tritons, cut in
ivory, are in one corner of the bow. Altogether, it is
a very original and singularly beautiful instrument. It
has the rich look of the Middle Ages, and would have
been a right royal gift for some princely troubadour....
The wood is extremely soft, and very thick. The
upper covering is of an exceedingly rare species of
Swiss pine, celebrated in the manufacture of violins.
It grows on the Italian side of the Alps; for sunshine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and song seem inseparably connected, and the balmy
atmosphere which makes Italy so rich in music, and
imparts to her language such liquid melody, seems
breathed into her trees. Those acquainted with music
are well aware that the value of an instrument is prodigiously
increased by the age of the wood, and that the
purity of its tone depends very much on the skillfulness
of the hand which has played upon it.</p>

<p>As the best and brightest human soul can never free
itself entirely from the influence of base and vulgar
associations in youth, so a violin never quite recovers
from the effect of discordant vibrations. So perceptible
is this to a delicate ear, that when Ole Bull first performed
in Philadelphia, he at once perceived that the
double bass&#8211;viol in the orchestra was a very old instrument,
and had been well played on. Some time after,
the horse and rider that represented General Putnam&#8217;s
leap down the precipice, plunged into the orchestra of
the theatre and crushed the old bass&#8211;viol. As soon as
Ole Bull became aware of the accident he hastened to
buy the fragments. The wood of his violin was so old,
and so thoroughly vibrated, that he had never been able
to obtain a sounding&#8211;post adapted to it.</p>

<p>This post is an extremely small piece of wood in the
interior of the instrument, but the inharmonious vibration
between the old and the new disturbed his sensitive
ear, until he was enabled to remedy the slight defect
by a fragment of the double&#8211;bass.</p>

<p>One of the most curious facts in connection with this
memorable violin is, that it was probably never played
upon by any other hand than Ole Bull&#8217;s, though it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
three hundred years old. It had always been preserved
as a curiosity, and when it came into his possession it
had no bar inside, nor any indication that such a necessary
appendage had ever been put into it. The inward
spiritual carving has been entirely done by this &#8220;Amphion
of the North,&#8221; as he is styled by Andersen, the
celebrated Danish novelist. The interior is completely
covered with indentations in ovals and circles produced
by the vibration of his magic tones. Doubtless the angels
could sing from them fragmentary melodies of the
universe; but to us they reveal no more than wave&#8211;marks
on the shores of the ever&#8211;rolling sea.</p></div>

<p>Some of the concerts on the Rhine had not
been well announced and prepared, and the artist
found himself just too early or late for royal
visitors; but the feeling of disappointment expressed
in his letters was only transient. In
Dresden his wife and child joined him. He gave
two concerts there, and then went to Prague.</p>

<p>February 9, 1841, he writes from that city:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My time has been taken up by illness, parties, rehearsals,
concerts; I have already played seven times in
public here, five times on my own account, and twice
for others. I play to&#8211;day and then rest until Sunday,
when I play my new &#8220;Concerto in E minor&#8221; for the
first time. It is not yet finished, but I have time
enough. I have met with such enthusiasm here as I do
not remember to have witnessed in any other country.</p></div>

<p>Again, on February 17, 1841, he writes:&#8212;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I seem to belong to the world here rather than myself.
I am invited every day to dinners, suppers, balls,
soirées, matinées, and the Lord knows what. If I decline,
they come again, until I yield, and if I accept once
I cannot refuse again without a plausible excuse....
My concerts are crowded and my own opinion (also expressed
by others) is that I have played pretty well in
Prague, especially at my concert last Sunday forenoon
for the benefit of the widows of poor musicians. I
played my new composition, the most difficult of all my
pieces. It was finished Saturday morning at half&#8211;past
eleven o&#8217;clock, the rehearsal took place at half&#8211;past
three, and the next day at noon I played it in public. I
shall play it again to&#8211;morrow, making some alterations....
I have had flowers, wreaths, and poems thrown me;
one in German, as you can now read it, I send you.
Some written in Bohemian and translated for me are
very beautiful.</p></div>

<p>The following bears date, March 1, 1841:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have just given my eleventh and last concert here,
and although nobody remembers so successful a concert
in Prague, and all ask me to give one more, as many
persons could not obtain seats for this, I am compelled
to leave in order to reach Russia in due time. I played
a new composition, &#8220;<span lang="de">Grüss aus des Ferne</span>.&#8221; It was
finished only at half&#8211;past seven on the morning of the
concert. It was a success.... My warmest greetings
to Prof. Dahl.<a name="Anchor-11" id="Anchor-11"></a><a href="#Footnote-11" class="Anchor" title="Go to footnote 11.">[11]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>From Prague Ole Bull went via Breslau to
Warsaw, where he played the &#8220;<span lang="it">Polacca Guerriera</span>.&#8221;
The youth of the city requested its repetition,
but many told him that it only revived in
the Poles the memory of their lost liberty, and he
did not play it again.</p>

<p>From Wilna he went to St. Petersburg, where
a serious illness prostrated him. He writes from
there May 4, 1841:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You ask me to give you a detailed account of what
you call my triumphs. On the road from Wilna to St.
Petersburg my carriage broke down three times; the
mud went over the wheels, and eight horses had the
greatest difficulty in drawing it out and onward. There
was no end of trouble at each station to get horses,
although I had a <i>podoroshna</i>, or authorization from the
government.... Thursday evening I played at the
residence of the Countess Rossi (the celebrated Sontag),
and you will like to know that I played well. I
leave at once for Moscow....</p></div>

<p>Again, May 22d, he writes:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I had some sea&#8211;captains from Bergen to dine and
celebrate with me the 17th of May, at my hotel. They
said we were expected in Bergen.... When it was
known that I intended to leave the city without giving
a concert, a deputation came from the orchestra, urging
me to play.... I accepted on condition that they
should arrange everything for me, that I need not be
obliged to leave my room. This will detain me here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
longer than I had anticipated.... I have to build castles
in the air to try and forget that I am a prisoner,
but I have often been thankful that you were not here
to share the hardships of this journey with me....</p></div>

<p>As soon as he was able he joined his wife in
Dresden, and they went via Hamburg to Norway,
to his mother&#8217;s house, at Valestrand, near
Bergen. This was the summer home of his
childhood. For generations it had been in the
possession of his father&#8217;s family, and he afterwards
purchased it, built a house, and lived there
some ten or twelve years.</p>

<p>Ole Bull spent the summer of 1841 at Valestrand
very quietly. In December he went to
Christiania, whence he writes:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For my encore last evening I gave them an improvisation
on the National Hymn. I may decide to give
a good number of concerts, as they are fighting like
wolves for seats. The king is to come soon, and I
should like to remain a little longer to see the good old
man. Countess Wedel has invited me to spend Christmas
week at Jarlsberg, and I am sorry that I cannot.
Löwenskjold is extremely attentive to me.... The
Egebergs are as affectionate and true friends as ever;
glad when I come, and never complaining when I do
not, which makes them still dearer to me, if possible.
This family have ever had a great influence on my life;
they helped me when I was in sore need, and gave me
good advice; they encouraged and assisted me in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
way in their power, and always without permitting my
gratitude to become a burden.</p></div>

<p>January 11, 1842, he writes:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It was three o&#8217;clock this morning before I got to bed,
as the actors at the theatre and about a hundred of my
friends had arranged a company for me, which really
was delightful.... When I entered the hall a chorus
sang a poem written by A. Munch, to a melody from
the &#8220;Polacca.&#8221;... At supper your health and the children&#8217;s
was proposed and drank, and I responded with
my violin.... When am I to be permitted to lead a
peaceful domestic life with you and our little ones?</p></div>

<p>His first concert in Christiania was given for
the benefit of the theatre. The banquet which
he mentioned took place just before his departure.
The following is a quotation from one of
the local papers:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Many songs and poems were written in his honor,
and the warmth and pathos of the melodies he played
so thrilled all present that they believed they had never
heard him play so well. The guests accompanied him
<i>en masse</i> to his hotel, and cheered again and again.</p></div>

<p>The next incident of interest was his concert
at Lund, where he went via Frederikshald and
Gottenburg. The price of the tickets was very
moderate,&#8212;one dollar,&#8212;but many were sold
for ten. The people received him most cordially,
and an address of welcome was made by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
chancellor of the University, to which the artist
replied with his violin. On his departure the students
accompanied him in procession, and bade
him farewell with songs and cheers. On the 19th
of February he went to Copenhagen and Hamburg,
where he gave six concerts to crowded
houses; then to Amsterdam, where he gave six
more concerts, and quite electrified the phlegmatic
Dutch. His concerts were an artistic, and
at last a financial, success, but it was a success
which he conquered.</p>

<p>He writes May 2, 1842, from Amsterdam:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>What shall I say to you of my troubles and vexations!
As I could confide them to no one, they have dwelt in
my heart. Art is ever dearly bought, and the true
artist easily deceived, for it is only by renouncing the
material good that he may obtain the divine happiness
of following the guidance of his imagination and
creative power. To understand himself rightly, he
must renounce all else, give himself wholly to his art,
and fight ignorance and stupidity. I am not the man
to give up the battle, but how many wounds and blows
before one reaches the goal! The recompense art gives
is a success even in failure. Last year Rubini and
Madame Persiani at the same prices&#8212;it really seems
impossible&#8212;gave concerts here to empty benches.</p></div>

<p>In June he returned to Bergen, via Hamburg.
In September he went to Christiania to assist a
Swedish artist, and in December gave his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
concerts. In January, 1843, he visited Sweden,
and Wergeland says:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>After giving concerts at Carlstad and Orebro, he
arrived one night, at one o&#8217;clock, at Upsala, dragged in
a huge old coach by six horses through the snow. Upsala,
cosily nestled among forest&#8211;clad hills, is one of
the oldest and most remarkable cities of Sweden. One
thousand years ago it was the principal centre of heathen
worship. In the low temple, on the rude altar,
the Vikings came to offer up to Odin and Thor the
customary Yule sacrifice. All the great movements
in the Swedish history of those early days were inaugurated
in this temple, and dim memories thickly
shroud the place. Four hundred years ago the first
Swedish university was founded. All the science, art,
literature, and poetry the Swedish people have produced
originated there; and many illustrious names, such as
Linnæus and Berzelius, shed their radiant halo far beyond
the boundaries of the country. Upsala now is
only a student&#8217;s camp. Libraries, lecture halls, laboratories,
museums, and dormitories cluster around the
cathedral, and all the life of the place has been absorbed
by the one institution&#8212;the University. Ole
Bull came to Upsala not to give a concert, but to play
for the students. It is true, as Jules Janin said of him,
his violin is his love, his art his life. To express himself
in tones and be understood is his one great joy,
and he went to Upsala because the students have, and
always have had, a great reputation for musical sensibility
and musical education. But his entry was not very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
propitious. The night was dark, no inn was to be discovered,
and the cold was biting. Suddenly a swarm of
young students returning from a Christmas masquerade
singing, dancing, and making merry, came along,
and, of course, the large old coach and six became the
butt of their frolic. It ended in Ole Bull&#8217;s ordering the
coach to turn about and drive back to Stockholm.</p></div>

<p>This occurrence led to some misrepresentations
and ill&#8211;natured comments in the local journals, to
which Ole Bull replied in a letter published in the
<i>Aftenbladet</i>, January 22, 1843. After explaining
the circumstances, and reminding those who had
accused him of failing to keep an engagement
that no concert had been announced, and that he
was therefore free to act as he thought best, he
concludes thus:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Although I do not recognize the right of any man to
call me to account for my conduct when I have wronged
nobody, although I believe I ought not to be excluded
from the universal right of a man to determine his own
actions, still, I am willing to state briefly my motives
for leaving Upsala without playing, cherishing the hope
that a cultured and impartial public will feel and agree
with me that it was something quite other than a freakish
temperament which led me to take that step.</p>

<p>I had laid my route by way of Upsala with the intention
of inviting, as I had done in Lund, the students of
the University to attend my concert, cherishing the fond
hope that the cultivated young men at Sweden&#8217;s first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
University would kindly receive, through me, a musical
greeting from the brother&#8211;land, and give me their approbation.
Although the insignificant affair which took
place on my arrival in Upsala of itself neither could so
offend me that it should lead me to leave the town in
&#8220;angry mood,&#8221; nor seduce me to such an act of injustice
as to lay the fault of a few thoughtless young
men at the door of a numerous and honorable corporation,
still, every one who intelligently and impartially
examines the matter will see that it brought me into a
frame of mind not at all in harmony with the problem
I was about to solve. Consequently, it was not anger
on account of the wrong I had suffered, or ill&#8211;will toward
Upsala town and the students, but despondency
and dejected spirits which led me so quietly to leave a
town which I both desire and expect to see again under
more favorable circumstances, for no one recognizes
more fully than I that it is the aim and object of art to
unite, not to disunite.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Ole Bull.</span></p></div>

<p>The renowned historian, Professor Gustaf Geijer,
now wrote to Ole Bull, urging him to come
to Upsala. He cordially consented, and to his
first concert he invited the whole body of students.
Each selection played by the violinist was
warmly applauded, and the excitement culminated
in the wildest enthusiasm, when, at the request
of Professor Geijer, he improvised variations on
the popular Swedish melody, &#8220;Lille Karen.&#8221; At
the close of the concert he was met in the vestibule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
by the students, who escorted him with
songs and cheers to his hotel, where they finally
dispersed after giving a hearty cheer in response
to his few words of thanks. At six o&#8217;clock a
&#8220;Sexa&#8221; was given in the large University Hall.
A letter published at this time, said:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The artist, whose frank, attractive manner won him
all hearts, in responding to the toast proposed in his
honor, dwelt especially on the good&#8211;will which in his
person had been shown the brother kingdom and Norse
people, and when lifted on the &#8220;golden chair,&#8221;<a name="Anchor-12" id="Anchor-12"></a><a href="#Footnote-12" class="Anchor" title="Go to footnote 12.">[12]</a> proposed
from his elevated seat the toast, &#8220;Sweden for
ever!&#8221; while from the same height Professor Geijer
emptied his glass to &#8220;his boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sentiment after sentiment was given, and the guest
of the evening at last expressed his happiness at the
misadventure of his first visit, which had caused him
to know better possibly than he would otherwise have
done, the students of Upsala. After midnight the company
followed him to his door, and he promised another
concert in the University Hall, where he said he had
received the greatest honor of his life. No other artist
has been the recipient of such homage.</p></div>

<p>His second concert was, if possible, a greater
success than the first, and both Bishop Faxe and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Professor Geijer thanked him in behalf of the
Upsala people.</p>

<p>From Upsala Ole Bull returned to Stockholm.
There he had very serious trouble, to which he
refers in a letter to his wife, January 26, 1843, as
follows:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Pratté wrote his dear friend Mr. R., who five years
since published that pamphlet against me in Copenhagen,
and told him that I had spoken ill of the king
and royal family, of the royal orchestra and its leader,
of the Swedes in general, and of Stockholm in particular.
He also sent a criticism to be published in the
papers. Mr. R. circulated these rumors, and succeeded
in making many enemies for me everywhere; but the
affair in Upsala, where I showed much moderation, has
already disarmed many people, and the public begin to
know how matters stand. To R.&#8217;s published attacks I
have made no reply. <i lang="fr">Qui s&#8217;excuse s&#8217;accuse</i>&#8212;and he is
getting to be too well known to lead people astray
longer. Pratté wrote to R. that Henrik Wergeland was
the author of the critique. It is simply absurd to impute
to him such meanness. We must hope that all
will turn out for the best.</p></div>

<p>February 6, 1843, he writes:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Intrigue against me has exhausted itself; but he who
endures slavery deserves to live a slave. I have thus
far been able to turn circumstances that seemed against
me to my advantage.</p></div>

<p>Ole Bull was deeply hurt and put to great inconvenience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
by the ill&#8211;will of the musicians of
Stockholm, and had been obliged to call in an
orchestra from a neighboring town; but in the
end his vindication was complete, and the weapons
of his assailants recoiled upon themselves.
He gave a concert at the palace, arranged by the
queen in honor of the king&#8217;s birthday, and was
received more warmly than ever. His detractors
had only helped to establish him more firmly in
the esteem of the people of the Swedish capital.</p>

<p>The twenty&#8211;fifth anniversary of Karl Johan&#8217;s
accession to the throne was also Ole Bull&#8217;s birthday,
and he invited the Norwegians in Stockholm
to celebrate the royal festivities, and played
the national melodies.</p>

<p>He soon received letters from Henrik Wergeland,
in whose house Pratté lived, and who was
indignant to find that his name should have been
used against his friend. It was to destroy this
vexatious fabrication that he determined to write
the sketch of Ole Bull&#8217;s life which is quoted so
often in the present memoir.</p>

<p>On his way from Upsala to Stockholm, Ole
Bull met at Jönköping his old teacher Lundholm,
who, it will be remembered, had prophesied that
his pupil would in time become as good a fiddler
as himself. It was at the close of a snowy day,
and the northern lights were shooting up the sky.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Lundholm, muffled in a bear skin, came along in
a sleigh, and unwrapping his face called out to
Ole Bull&#8217;s driver to stop. Then he shouted to
the artist: &#8220;Now that you are a celebrated violinist
remember that, when I heard you play Paganini,
I predicted your career would be a remarkable
one.&#8221; &#8220;You were mistaken,&#8221; cried Ole Bull,
jumping up; &#8220;I did not read Paganini at sight;
I had played it before.&#8221; &#8220;It makes no difference&#8212;good&#8211;by,&#8221;
and Lundholm urged on his horse
and in a moment was out of sight.</p>

<p>We must pass by pleasant incidents at various
cities and hurry on to Copenhagen, where he
gave three concerts to audiences numbering several
thousands. At the last concert he played his
new composition, &#8220;<span lang="it">Siciliano e Tarantella</span>,&#8221; which
he was obliged to repeat, and then to acknowledge
the ringing plaudits by playing a Norse
and Danish national song. He was so happy in
uniting these melodies, that the audience, when
he had finished, rose to their feet with cries of
&#8220;Viva Ole Bull!&#8221; While in Copenhagen he visited
the Students&#8217; Union, and on his entrance
was greeted by a song set to one of his own melodies:&#8212;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">
&#8220;Thanks for thy giving</span><br />
<span class="i0">Our spirits their freedom;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thanks for thy greeting</span><br />
<span class="i0">From Sigtuna town.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Bend but thy bow and</span><br />
<span class="i0">Send forth thy arrows,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Bleeds not the bosom</span><br />
<span class="i0">With lovelier wound.&#8221;</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>Here too the students escorted him to his
hotel; and the king gave him a handsome ring
in brilliants.</p>

<p>The celebrated violinist Ernst and the pianist
Döhler were in Copenhagen at this time, and all
three artists were living at the same hotel. They
were old friends and heartily enjoyed the reunion.
Ole Bull used to relate an amusing story of his
early acquaintance with Ernst in Paris in 1836.
He had been engaged by the Princess Damerond
to arrange and take part in some quartette music
at one of her soirées, and had secured the aid
of Ernst and the brothers Boucher. As the musicians
descended the stairs some white Polish
dogs followed them, snarling and barking, to the
salon. Ernst, who had on silk stockings and low
shoes, began to retreat, thus encouraging one of
the little brutes to bite him. The cur then
rushed at Ole Bull, who deliberately lifted it on
his toe and sent it up among the lights of the
great chandelier. The attendant found on picking
it up that the fall had killed it. The princess,
raised on a sort of dais at the end of the
apartment, had seen her pet&#8217;s mishap, and in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
agitation sent a messenger to request the musicians
to leave immediately. Ole Bull expressed
his willingness to comply with the gracious request,
so soon as the compensation of the artists
he had engaged should be handed him. Her
feelings were somewhat mollified at this suggestion,
but as three of the quartette had already
left, there was no other course but to pay him
the twenty&#8211;five louis d&#8217;or, which the four friends
spent in a supper at the Palais&#8211;Royal.</p>

<p>In April Ole Bull left Copenhagen, and gave
concerts in Kiel, Hamburg, Bremen, and Oldenburg,
returning to Hamburg. He there met
Fanny Elssler, who had just returned from the
United States. She urged him to try a season in
that country, and he decided to make the trip at
the earliest moment possible. Just at this time,
he saw a malicious attack upon himself written
by the secretary of Ernst and Döhler, but, as he
discovered, without their knowledge. To meet
this attack, so far as it denounced his compositions,
he gave Schubert three of his pieces for
publication&#8212;the first and last he ever published.
These were, &#8220;<span lang="it">Variazioni di Bravoura,&#8221; &#8220;La Preghiera
d&#8217;una Madre&#8221; (Adagio Religioso),</span> and &#8220;<span lang="it">Il
Notturno</span>.&#8221; They were all received with great
favor by the critics at the time.</p>

<p>On the 19th of May, he wrote his wife from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Hamburg of his happiness that a daughter had
been born to them. He also referred to the attack
made upon him by Ernst&#8217;s secretary. &#8220;If
artists will make light of and ignore calumny
and censure,&#8221; he said, &#8220;they are sure to repent
it in the end. They may keep their nobility of
soul, but they will lose the respect of the public,
and confidence in their own merits will be
weakened. As I am about to go abroad I desire
to leave behind some remembrance of myself, and
have given Schubert certain pieces to publish.&#8221;</p>

<p>In June he returned again to Copenhagen, and
the enthusiasm then was, if possible, greater than
ever. Ole Bull and his compositions became the
universal topic of the newspaper paragraphers
and of the people. Before the end of the month
he went again to Christiania, and the illustrious
Danish poet, Adam Öhlenschläger, happened to
be a fellow&#8211;passenger on the steamer. In his
&#8220;Reminiscences&#8221; the latter says:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In 1843 I went with my youngest son, William, to
Norway. One of our fellow&#8211;travelers was the violinist,
Ole Bull, who, because of his own talent, has acquired
not only a European but a world&#8211;wide celebrity. He had
often awakened my admiration as well as my astonishment.
His life is remarkable. He came as a poor unknown
musician to Paris, and had suffered the most extreme
want, when he was recognized, heard, appreciated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
loved, married, and soon acquired by his concerts a considerable
fortune. His musical performances were an
expression of his own character, a peculiar combination
of a charming, childlike good&#8211;nature and tenderness,
often interrupted by a restless excitement. Thus the
most beautiful, ravishing tones and most genial fancies
alternated with sudden piercing shrieks. It seemed as
if Ole Bull with capricious fickleness delighted in destroying
the tenderest and loftiest sentiment which he
had evoked, and in offending those whom he had
charmed, with oddities which did not control himself,
but which he in a proud mood called forth whenever he
pleased. He frequently appeared to me like a painter,
who shows us a beautiful picture which he has just
finished, and just as we are about to examine it more
closely he draws his brush over it and blots it all out
again. Still, justice must be done him. We heard
many a charming piece that was not thus interrupted,
and it is quite probable that this manner of his has
been entirely abandoned in his riper years. No one
ever played so charmingly as he an adagio of Mozart.
In it he was able to subdue completely those grating
features of a too violent individuality. I say he was
precisely thus in his life. He sometimes spoiled the
good he had done, but, with a childlike nature that was
most becoming to the strong, fair young Norseman, it
cost him no effort, on the other hand, to make amends
for the harm he had done.</p>

<p>When he at one time, on board the steamer, had
caused my displeasure by a too severe criticism of the
Swedes and I had taken my seat on a bench, he came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
leaping toward me on his hands and feet and barked at
me like a dog. This was a no less original than amiable
manner of bringing about a reconciliation. He often
visited me in Copenhagen. In Christiania, where his
young and beautiful wife resided, who as a Parisian did
not find life in the North very agreeable, we dined with
him, and on leaving he was kind enough to offer us one
of his carriages for the journey to Bergen, his native
town, whither he also soon was going. He was very
strong, his arms were like steel, and it is very possible
that it was his excessive physical strength which occasionally
interrupted the tender tones, while he shook
his head so that his hair fell down into his beautiful
brown eyes.... When he played for the king in Copenhagen,
and Frederick VI. asked him who had taught
him to play, he answered &#8220;The Mountains of Norway,
your majesty.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>From Christiania Ole Bull went to Trondhjem,
and at his concerts there, and in all the Norse
towns the enthusiasm was unbounded. On the
12th of July, 1843, he writes:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have been on the Dovrefjeld since yesterday evening.
It commands a splendid view, being the highest
mountain in Norway, eight thousand feet above the
level of the sea. As we ascended it began to rain, then
to snow and hail very hard. The thunder and lightning
had a weird effect. I was from the noon of one day
until four the next morning ascending and descending
the mountain from Jerkind. G., who was unused to
mountain climbing, failed to reach the summit; he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
almost buried in the snow. Some Englishmen were of
the party. I outwalked the guide, and reached the top
before the others. A passing traveler does me the kindness
to forward this to you.</p></div>

<p>From Trondhjem he writes:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Gertner will remain here to paint the cathedral, which
is a splendid structure and eight hundred years old. I
gave a concert without any assistance, playing nearly
two hours without cessation. It was very fatiguing, but,
at least, nothing was ruined by a bad accompaniment,
and the audience was pleased.</p></div>

<p>On the way from Bergen to Christiania, he
stopped at several points to play for the peasants.
Especially memorable to him was the scene in
Sogn. He found many of the people in their
Sunday dress, assembled in the quaint Borgund
church, which has stood there some eight hundred
years; and, with a driving storm outside, he
played for them the folk&#8211;songs, as old, probably,
as the edifice which sheltered them. Ole Bull
visited this church again in 1879. On this, his
last trip over the mountains, knots of working&#8211;men
had assembled to greet him. Every hat was
lifted and hearty cheers were given as the carriage
rolled past. Wergeland says:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ole Bull&#8217;s power, exercised through his violin over an
audience, was truly wonderful. Once, on a journey in
Norway, he played for a number of peasants whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
incidentally found gathered in an inn. When he finished
playing the deepest silence prevailed. Only the
ticking of the big watches in their pockets was heard,
when suddenly one of the men struck out his hand, and
with great emphasis cried aloud, &#8220;This is a lie.&#8221; If
true mental power consists in lifting the unconscious
forces of life into the light of the conscious, giving
them form and shape, converting them into thought
and will, Ole Bull&#8217;s playing was not a lie. His tones
fell on his hearers, like the first warm rain of spring,
with a blessing.</p></div>

<p>His last months in Norway were spent in making
preparations for the great journey to America.
August found him again in Christiania. On
the 11th of September he gave his farewell concert,
and left with his wife and three children on
the 16th, for Copenhagen. Wergeland, writing
of his departure, says: &#8220;He left for America, preceded
by his fame, and followed by thousands and
thousands of grateful farewells from his countrymen.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the 3d of October he gave a concert in
Luneburg, which was attended by the King of
Hanover and other royal personages; and, sending
his family to Paris, he went himself, by way
of Amsterdam and London, to Liverpool, where
he took passage. He wrote his wife from Liverpool,
November 4, 1843:&#8212;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>Wergeland&#8217;s celebrated poems to Ole Bull were
published at this time, and, like Welhaven&#8217;s, are
valued as among the finest lyrics in the Norse
literature.<a name="Anchor-13" id="Anchor-13"></a><a href="#Footnote-13" class="Anchor" title="Go to footnote 13.">[13]</a></p>

<p>Ole Bull landed in Boston, in November, 1843,
and went directly on to New York. His belief
in the sturdy common people of his own country
and his love of freedom made him anticipate with
great interest an acquaintance with a people who
governed for themselves, and this acquaintance
resulted in giving him greater hopes for his own
land, which he proudly felt was able to show already
the most liberal constitution of all the European
monarchical governments. He was then
and ever zealous to the utmost, that every precedent
which had been favorable to the growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
power of the Norse people, through their constitution,
should be jealously guarded. He insisted
that their only safety and good lay in a demand
for a fuller sovereignty of the people, and in
their better education for such power. To him,
therefore, the interest of his first visit and sojourn
in the American Republic was not confined
to his profession. He was from the first,
and to the last, an earnest student of republican
government and institutions.</p>

<p>His friend R. B. Anderson writes of him:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Extremes meet. Ole Bull was at once the most
perfect cosmopolitan and the most zealous patriot.
Having spent much of his time abroad in the various
European countries and in America, he had thoroughly
learned the peculiarities of all nationalities. He was a
keen observer. Mastering quickly the various European
vernaculars, and winning easily the hearts of the
people, he became conversant with the political and social
questions that agitate the different nations. He
was earnest in proclaiming their merits, but usually silent
as to their faults. His face would brighten at
every evidence he found of progress toward freedom of
thought and the establishment of liberal governments
in the various monarchical countries of Europe.</p>

<p>Ole Bull&#8217;s best thoughts were given to his own country,
to Norway. During all the years of conquest in his
profession, and all the honors bestowed upon him in
foreign lands, he never forgot his dear <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>&#8220;Gamle Norge.&#8221;
He ever talked with loving tenderness of Norway&#8217;s
gray mountains. He was but four years old when the
young Norway was born. When he went out into the
world the names Norway and Norwegian were scarcely
to be found in the European vocabularies, these terms
having previously been absorbed by Denmark and Dane.
With his fame and name, attention was everywhere
called to the fact that Norway had cast off the yoke of
Denmark, and asserted her right to exist as an independent
nation; and when people saw Ole Bull they said,
&#8220;A land that can foster such sons has an inalienable
right to its independence.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>His name was now to become a household
word through the length and breadth of the
United States. At first circumstances seemed
unfavorable. There were already two violinists
in New York&#8212;Vieuxtemps, who was assisted by
the famous singer Madame Damoreau, and Artot.
The French, loyal to their countrymen, made a
formidable opposition, and many difficulties had
to be encountered. Ole Bull gave his first concert
as early as the 23d of November. The contest
between the parties continued with much
vigor; the fact that not a Frenchman was present
at the Norwegian&#8217;s first concert made it now
a question between the French and Americans.
The papers were filled with contributions in prose
and in verse, witty epigrams, and cartoons. Victory
soon inclined to Ole Bull. With his first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
concert, he won the good&#8211;will of the Americans,
and ever afterwards held it. His audiences kept
growing, until he was obliged to play in larger
halls than were intended for concert purposes,
and oftentimes many were unable to gain admission.
The rapidity with which he traveled, and
the frequency of his performances, were also remarkable.
As an illustration of this, we will give
a list of his concerts for the month of December,
1843. After appearing in New York again on
the 29th of November, he gave the following concerts
in December:&#8212;</p>

<p>And up to 1879 many months of winter and
spring, and sometimes nine months of a year,
would show similar records of travel and work.
It was not his fine physique alone that enabled
him to bear the strain, but a rigid adherence to
simple diet and habits, with an almost total
abstinence from stimulants during the season of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
work, and constant exercise in the open air during
the summer vacation in Norway. He doubtless
traveled more miles and was heard by a larger
number of people than any other man among his
contemporaries.</p>

<p>Mrs. Child&#8217;s account of his New York concerts
written for the <i>Boston Courier</i>, and published later
in her &#8220;Letters from New York,&#8221; will be of interest.
She did not speak from the judgment of a
cultivated musical ear. She analyzed and expressed
the effects of Ole Bull&#8217;s performance on
the multitude.</p>

<p>In Mrs. Child&#8217;s first letter, she says:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have twice heard Ole Bull. I scarcely dare to tell
the impression his music made upon me. But, casting
aside all fear of ridicule for excessive enthusiasm, I will
say that it expressed to me more of the infinite than
I ever saw, or heard, or dreamed of, in the realms of
Nature, Art, or Imagination.</p>

<p>They tell me his performance is wonderfully skillful;
but I have not enough of scientific knowledge to judge
of the difficulties he overcomes. I can readily believe
of him, what Bettina says of Beethoven, that &#8220;his spirit
creates the inconceivable, and his fingers perform the
impossible.&#8221; He played on four strings at once, and
produced the rich harmony of four instruments. His
bow touched the strings as if in sport, and brought forth
light leaps of sound, with electric rapidity, yet clear in
their distinctness. He made his violin sing with flute&#8211;like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
voice, and accompany itself with a guitar, which
came in ever and anon like big drops of musical rain.
All this I felt as well as heard without the slightest
knowledge of <i>quartetto</i> or <i>staccato</i>. How he did it, I
know as little as I know how the sun shines, or the
spring brings forth its blossoms. I only know that
music came from his soul into mine, and carried it upward
to worship with the angels.</p>

<p>Oh, the exquisite delicacy of those notes! Now tripping
and fairy&#8211;like as the song of Ariel; now soft and
low as the breath of a sleeping babe, yet clear as a fine&#8211;toned
bell; now high as a lark soaring upward, till lost
among the stars!</p>

<p>Noble families sometimes double their names, to distinguish
themselves from collateral branches of inferior
rank. I have doubled his, and in memory of the Persian
nightingale have named him Ole Bulbul....</p>

<p>When urged to join the throng who are following this
star of the North, I coolly replied: &#8220;I never like lions;
moreover I am too ignorant of musical science to appreciate
his skill!&#8221; But when I heard this man, I at
once recognized a power that transcends science, and
which mere skill may toil after in vain. I had no need
of knowledge to feel this subtle influence, any more
than I needed to study optics to perceive the beauty of
the rainbow. It overcame me like a miracle, I felt
that my soul was for the first time baptized in music;
that my spiritual relations were somehow changed by
it, and that I should henceforth be otherwise than I had
been. I was so oppressed with &#8220;the exceeding weight
of glory&#8221; that I drew my breath with difficulty.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As I came out of the building, the street sounds hurt
me with their harshness. The sight of ragged boys and
importunate coachmen jarred more than ever on my
feelings. I wanted that the angels that had ministered
to my spirit should attune theirs also. It seemed to
me as if such music should bring all the world into the
harmonious beauty of divine order. I passed by my
earthly home and knew it not. My spirit seemed to be
floating through infinite space. The next day I felt
like a person who had been in a trance, seen heaven
opened, and then returned to earth again.</p>

<p>This doubtless appears very excessive in one who
has passed the enthusiasm of youth, with a frame too
healthy and substantial to be conscious of nerves, and
with a mind instinctively opposed to lion&#8211;worship. In
truth it seems wonderful to myself; but so it was.
Like a romantic girl of sixteen, I would pick up the
broken string of his violin and wear it as a relic, with
a half superstitious feeling that some mysterious magic
of melody lay hidden therein.</p>

<p>I know not whether others were as powerfully
wrought upon as myself; for my whole being passed
into my ear, and the faces around me were invisible.
But the exceeding stillness showed that the spirits of
the multitude bowed down before the magician. While
he was playing, the rustling of a leaf might have been
heard; and when he closed, the tremendous bursts of
applause told how the hearts of thousands leaped up
like one.</p>

<p>His personal appearance increases the charm. He
looks pure, natural, and vigorous, as I imagine Adam in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Paradise. His inspired soul dwells in a strong frame,
of admirable proportions, and looks out intensely from
his earnest eyes. Whatever may be his theological
opinions, the religious <i>sentiment</i> must be strong in his
nature; for Teutonic reverence, mingled with impassioned
inspiration, shines through his honest Northern
face and runs through all his music. I speak of him as
he appears while he and his violin converse together.
When not playing there is nothing observable in his appearance,
except genuine health, the unconscious calmness
of strength in repose, and the most unaffected simplicity
in dress and in manner. But when he takes his
violin and holds it so caressingly to his ear to catch the
faint vibration of its strings, it seems as if &#8220;the angels
were whispering to him.&#8221; As his fingers sweep across
the strings, the angels pass into his soul, give him their
tones, and look out from his eyes, with the wondrous
beauty of inspiration. His motions sway to the music
like a tree in the winds; for soul and body chord. In
fact &#8220;his soul is but a harp, which an infinite breath
modulates; his senses are but strings, which weave the
passing air into rhythm and cadence.&#8221;</p>

<p>If it be true, as has been said, that a person ignorant
of the rules of music, who gives himself up to its influence,
without knowing whence it comes or whither
it goes, experiences, more than the scientific, the passionate
joy of the composer himself in his moments of
inspiration, then was I blest in my ignorance. While I
listened, music was to my soul what the atmosphere is
to my body; it was the breath of my inward life. I felt
more deeply than ever that music is the highest symbol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
of the infinite and holy. I heard it moan plaintively
over the discords of society, and the dimmed beauty of
humanity. It filled me with inexpressible longing to
see man at one with Nature and with God; and it
thrilled me with joyful prophecy that the hope would
pass into glorious fulfillment.</p>

<p>With renewed force I felt what I have often said,
that the secret of creation lay in music. &#8220;A <i>voice</i> to
light gave being.&#8221; Sound led the stars into their places
and taught chemical affinities to waltz into each others&#8217;
arms.</p>

<p>Some who never like to admit that the greatest stands
before them say that Paganini played the &#8220;Carnival of
Venice&#8221; better than his Norwegian rival. I know not.
But if ever laughter ran along the chords of musical instrument
with a wilder joy, if ever tones quarreled with
more delightful dissonance, if ever violin frolicked with
more capricious grace than Ole Bulbul&#8217;s in that fantastic
whirl of melody, I envy the ears that heard it....</p>

<p>His reception in New York has exceeded all preceding
stars. His first audience were beside themselves
with delight, and the orchestra threw down their instruments
in ecstatic wonder. Familiarity with his
performance brings less excitement, but I think more
pleasure.</p></div>

<p>From Richmond Ole Bull went to Charleston,
and thence to New Orleans. He gave five concerts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
in that city at the same time that Vieuxtemps
and Madame Damoreau were giving a series
of soireés. The Spanish, English, and German
papers rivaled the American in their friendly
criticisms of his performances. After three concerts
in Mobile, he returned again to New Orleans
for two final concerts there.</p>

<p>An anecdote of one of his first Southern visits,
told by the late Mr. Thomas R. Gould, the sculptor,
is illustrative of his many curious adventures
at that time. A large diamond in his violin bow,
which had been given him by the Duke of Devonshire
with the request that he should use it, had
attracted the attention of a man, who came to
him and told him that he wanted the stone. The
violinist replied, that, as it was a gift, it had
associations, and he could neither give it away
nor sell it. &#8220;But I am going to have that stone!&#8221;
said the man, as he began to draw his bowie knife
from the collar of his coat; but the movement
was parried by the musician&#8217;s muscular arm, and
the fellow was felled to the floor by a blow with
the edge of the hand across his throat. &#8220;The
next time I would kill you,&#8221; said Ole Bull, with
his foot on the man&#8217;s chest, &#8220;but you may go
now.&#8221; On his release the fellow expressed his
admiration for Ole Bull&#8217;s dexterity and muscle,
and asked him to accept the bowie knife, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
he had meant to use against him. This was not
the only present of the kind he received&#8212;as five
knives, four given him in the Southern States,
and one in Spain, were kept among his curiosities
at home, and sometimes drew from him a story of
his adventures. He was often obliged, while in
the South, to take the cash box, after his concerts,
from one place to another, the banks being few
and far between, and was finally warned by detectives
of a gang of men who were following him
for the sake of plunder. He had several encounters
with them, and was more than once in serious
danger. He writes at this time:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My brave servant Henry watches over me as a father
over a son. He always fears that I may be attacked
by villains; but I do not think I am in danger from any
weaponed hand.</p></div>

<p>One more story will sufficiently illustrate his
Southern and Western adventures. Going down
the Mississippi, he met on the steamboat a party
of half&#8211;savage men, colonists from the far West.
While reading his newspaper he was accosted by
one of the men, who had been sent as spokesman
by his companions, with the request that the fiddler
would take a drink with them, offering him a
whiskey flask at the same time. &#8220;I thank you,&#8221;
said Ole Bull politely, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>&#8220;but I never drink whiskey.&#8221;
With a curse, the fellow asked if he was a
teetotaler. &#8220;No, but whiskey is like poison to me.&#8221;
&#8220;If you can&#8217;t drink, come and fight then!&#8221; The
man&#8217;s comrades had gathered round him meantime,
and they all cried, &#8220;If you won&#8217;t drink, you
must fight. You look d&#8209;&#8209;n strong; show us what
you are good for.&#8221; &#8220;A Norseman can fight as
well as anybody when his blood is up, but I can&#8217;t
fight when my blood is cold, and why should I?&#8221;
&#8220;You look like a strong fellow, and d&#8209;&#8209;n it, you
shall fight.&#8221; Seeing no way of escape, Ole Bull
quietly said, &#8220;Since you insist on testing my
strength and there is no reason for fighting, I will
tell you what I will do. Let any one of you take
hold of me in any way he likes, and I&#8217;ll wager
that in half a minute he shall lie on his back at
my feet.&#8221; A big fellow was chosen, who stepped
forward and grasped the violinist round the waist,
but was instantly thrown over his head by a sudden
wrench and lay senseless on the deck. Ole
Bull now felt himself in a very uncomfortable position,
for he saw one of the man&#8217;s comrades draw
his bowie knife, but was relieved when it was used
only to open a flask. A good dose of its contents
poured down his throat soon revived the fainting
man, and his first question, &#8220;How the devil was I
thrown down here?&#8221; was answered by a shout of
laughter from his companions, in which he himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
joined. He sprang to his feet, and after vainly
trying to persuade Ole Bull to show him how he
had thrown him, he said: &#8220;Take this knife home
with you; you fight d&#8212;d well; you are as quick
as lightning!&#8221; The artist heard of the same fellow
later as having gone to an editor to call him to
account for an adverse criticism on his playing,
ready to fight for &#8220;the strongest fiddler he had
ever seen, anyhow!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ole Bull now decided to visit Cuba, and landed
in Havana. He there wrote two compositions
on Cuban motives: &#8220;<span lang="es">Agiaco Cubano</span>,&#8221; and &#8220;<span lang="es">Recuerdos
de la Habana</span>,&#8221; which he played at his
last concert.</p>

<p>He wrote to his wife from New Orleans, January
24, 1844:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All these days we have had summer weather, very
warm but extremely damp; the atmosphere is very
heavy, and my strings break constantly.... Yesterday
I gave my last concert in New Orleans for this
visit; I was overwhelmed with bouquets and flowers. I
have practiced speech&#8211;making, and it goes better than
one would think, as I have no facility in speaking English;
but a firm will can accomplish much.... The
French are still pursuing me, that they may hold up
Vieuxtemps and Artot; they invent all manner of outrageous
stories to lower me in the public estimation,
but as yet without success. It is probable that these
rumors will be circulated in Paris, with the same end in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
view. Well, my dear, one must bear much malice and
misrepresentation when he has become a public character,
and you know I have already had my share; but, at
the same time, I have met with forbearance and generosity,
and this ought not to be forgotten. My life has
hitherto, as you know, been a most changeful one, and
superhuman strength is sometimes needed to enable
one to stand against such infamous attacks and&#8212;keep
silence. But enough of this.... I am sorry you are
not satisfied with the nurse Miette; she is the only servant
to whom I feel really indebted for the care she has
given our children, and I believe that she loves us. Try
to overlook little faults, which are of no consequence;
we must remember her good qualities, and the attachment
she has shown us in the past. Give her my greetings,
say that I am grateful for all the love she has
shown our children up to this time, and that I thank
her for what I know she will still do in the future....
My regards to the Vuillaumes. Say that when I return
I desire to play in Paris. They shall see that I have
not wasted my time during our separation....</p></div>

<p>He also wrote of Havana as follows:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I was advised to be very careful; not to expose myself
to the sun or moonlight, to keep quiet after dinner, and
to eat no fruit in the evening. As I heeded this advice,
I remained seven weeks in Havana without an attack
of the yellow fever or the diseases raging there. I gave
ten concerts, four in the principal theatre and six in the
immense Tacon Theatre. To show the inhabitants how
grateful I felt for their enthusiasm, I composed two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
pieces, in which I introduced some of the most popular
Cuban airs. I think you will like them. I was much
excited and nearly beside myself when I composed and
played them for a people so favored by nature and climate.
The fairy&#8211;like and beautiful climate of the tropics
surpasses all description. How strange to see an
orchestra composed almost without exception of negroes
and mulattoes! Their faces recorded the sentiments
and passion of the music, at times laughing, then
weeping, and sometimes rolling their eyes in a melancholy
fashion, as they turned their good&#8211;natured physiognomies
to the audience, to their music stands, or
towards me. They are the best musicians in all America!
In the &#8220;Polacca,&#8221; which was demanded at nearly
every concert, I was accompanied by picked players
from the seven regimental bands in Havana.</p>

<p>But suddenly a dangerous conspiracy was discovered
among the negroes; they had planned to poison all the
whites on the island! The owners of several sugar and
coffee plantations were murdered in the most barbarous
manner; nobody dared to go out after dark; the soldiers
killed people in the streets without warning, nor
were they called to account for it. More than seven
hundred negroes were shot by order of the governor. I
had engaged support, and my expenses were four thousand
francs a night. I considered myself fortunate not
to lose money in the circumstances. But who could
foresee such a catastrophe? I exerted all my strength
in that intense heat. I played with all possible animation,
and truly the enthusiasm of the Havanese paid me
amply for my exertions! They sent me many beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
poems, and garlands enough to cover the stage; one of
the wreaths, with inscriptions, I have saved for you, my
beloved.... I shall work for you and our children, and
do all in my power to assure them a good education.
This is a great and sacred duty, which gives me strength
to brave all danger. From Havana I returned by sea
to Charleston. I slept for a couple of hours exposed to
the sun, and the consequence was that my whole body,
a week after, was poisoned. My face was covered with
a thick crust, and I suffered very much; it was a miracle
that I did not die on the spot! But I treated myself
with cold water, ate very little, took cold baths and
much exercise.... I pray you not to have the least
anxiety, since I am now well again.</p></div>

<p>From Charleston he went to Columbia and
Norfolk, and thence by sea to Baltimore, giving
concerts in each place. He then went direct to
Boston, by way of New York, where Schubert
(who had come with him from Hamburg as secretary)
had him arrested for debt, though in reality
Schubert was himself indebted to Ole Bull for the
publication of his compositions. The arrest compelled
Ole Bull to give security for $5,000, and
brought upon him a troublesome lawsuit, which
was not decided till 1852, and then in his favor. He
never received from Schubert a penny of the sum
promised him for his compositions, which passed
through many editions. This attempted detention
was intended to prevent the artist&#8217;s meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
his engagements in Boston, but it rather benefited
than injured him, so far as the public was concerned.
He gave his concerts in Boston in the
&#8220;Melodeon,&#8221; which seated 2,000 persons, but the
orchestra had to go on the stage to make room
for more seats. The papers were filled with
articles and anecdotes concerning his life and
work. A visit which he made to a lady, too ill to
attend his concerts, taking his violin and playing
for her, was commented on; but to his countrymen
at home, who knew how often he had done
this, for the sick or poor, special mention of the
incident seemed strange. The insane hospitals
were often visited by him in the different cities,
and he felt a real pleasure in seeing the delight
that his playing gave the inmates.</p>

<p>No expression of thanks for a visit to the sick&#8211;room
was ever more appreciative than the account
written by Alice Cary of his coming one morning,
after she was confined to her room during
her last illness, and bringing the cheer and comfort
of his voice and instrument. Her sensitive,
beautiful face was radiant with a loving welcome,
which kept bravely back the pain and weakness
fast gaining the ascendency. Fearing that this
was to be his last sight of her, he resolved that
he would share and soothe one of the many hours
of pain and apprehension, which those noble and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
lovely women were bearing so patiently. When
he again visited this country, both Alice and
Phebe Cary had passed away, leaving their friends
how much the poorer for their loss!</p>

<p>Mrs. Mary Clemmer, in a letter recently received,
says:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My own first personal meeting with Ole Bull was at
the house of Alice Cary; indeed, on that special evening
she invited him expressly to give me the great
pleasure of meeting him.</p>

<p>Before I saw him, she said: &#8220;In meeting Ole Bull I
seem to renew my entire youth; not merely the years
of youth, but all the freshness, fullness, rapturous sweetness
of its impressions. I have the feeling that should
I stay in his presence I could never grow old. It is
many years since I have met any human being who
could arouse in me such emotions.&#8221;...</p>

<p>Recalling what the presence and music of Ole Bull
were to Alice Cary in her comparative health and fullness
of life, you can realize what they must have been
to charm and uplift her spirit when, wistfully dropping
human loves, with pathetic grief, yet with abiding faith,
she stood at the very close of the valley of shadows, listening
to his seraphic strains, sweet to pain, yet full of
the promise and melody of heaven.</p>

<p>You may be sure, in the silence that came afterwards,
<i>she</i> breathed out her swan&#8211;song to him.</p></div>

<p>Of this first visit to Boston and the many things
written concerning it, none were of more interest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
perhaps, than this extract from Margaret Fuller&#8217;s
private journal, written in March, 1844, and sent
by a friend afterwards to the artist:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At six o&#8217;clock William and C&#8209;&#8209;&#8209;&#8209; came out with
carriage to take me to the Ole Bull concert. The music
this evening plunged me in anguish, and raised me to
rapture. The &#8220;Mountains of Norway,&#8221; and the &#8220;<span lang="it">Siciliano
e Tarantella</span>&#8221; were the great pieces. The last is
unlike anything I ever heard, and <i>how</i> he looked when
he played it! When encored, he played, among other
things, &#8220;On the Lake where drooped the Willow,&#8221; and
again, &#8220;The Last Rose of Summer.&#8221; He loves that as
I do. I could not sleep at all, and went up to C.&#8217;s room
and wrote.</p>

<p>Evening. Ole Bull again. I am extremely happy in
him. He is one of my kin....</p>

<p>He played to&#8211;night, first, &#8220;Recollections of Havana.&#8221;
This begins with a great swelling movement in the
orchestra, and then his part comes in like the under&#8211;song
of thought. I do not know whether the piece was
fine or not. I soon forgot it, and was borne away into
the winged life. Being encored, he played &#8220;The Last
Rose of Summer,&#8221; and modulated into &#8220;Auld Robin
Gray.&#8221; These sweet simple strains of human tenderness
become celestial in his violin; their individual expression
is more, not less, definite by being thus purified.
Next, a &#8220;Notturno Amoroso,&#8221; and, being encored, the
&#8220;Adagio Religioso.&#8221; Both were enchanting. I felt
raised above all care, all pain, all fear, and every taint
of vulgarity was washed out of the world!</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>From Boston he went to the chief towns of
New England, New York, and Canada, returning
to Bristol, R. I., for rest in the months of August
and September. He there wrote down his musical
thoughts of Niagara. He had spent many
days at the falls at different times, and saw them
in all lights&#8212;in sun and storm. One evening
great forest fires added their blaze and glare to
the silvery shimmer of the moonlit rapids, and the
lurid light with the grand rush and roar of the
waters made a deep impression upon him. His
enjoyment was heightened during that visit by
the society of Mr. George Ticknor and his
family, whom he happened to meet there. He
had already been hospitably received by Mr.
Ticknor in Boston, and the notes of invitation
preserved among his papers show that their intercourse
at Niagara was of the same pleasant
nature. The last winter he spent in Boston,
when he again visited this house, so famous for
its generous hospitality, and was kindly welcomed
by the venerable hostess, grateful recollections of
the eminent man and scholar, who had done so
much to make him at home when a stranger,
crowded upon his memory.</p>

<p>While in Bristol Ole Bull had received a letter
from the directors of the Musical Fund Society in
Philadelphia, in which they asked him to appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
at their first concert for the season, and expressed
the hope that he would make his terms as moderate
as possible, as their object was to start a fund
for the support of poor musicians. He returned
a letter of thanks, and said &#8220;his only remuneration
should be the honor of assisting so highly
esteemed a society in its noble efforts.&#8221; When
they received this answer they resolved to strike
a medal in his honor, and it was presented to
him at the close of the concert.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Niagara,&#8221; which he played for the first
time in New York that winter of 1844, was disappointing
to the general public, while the criticisms
were favorable. It gradually came more
into favor, and was well received on its first performance
in Philadelphia. Another composition,
&#8220;The Solitude of the Prairies,&#8221; won a more immediate
popular success, and had to be played
at nearly every concert. A religious composition,
&#8220;David&#8217;s Psalm,&#8221; was also much liked.</p>

<p>N. P. Willis wrote as follows of the &#8220;Niagara&#8221;:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We believe that we have heard a transfusion into
music&#8212;not of &#8220;Niagara,&#8221; which the audience seemed
<i>bona&#8211;fide</i> to expect, but of the <i>pulses of a human heart
at Niagara</i>. We had a prophetic boding of the result
of calling the piece vaguely &#8220;Niagara,&#8221;&#8212;the listener
furnished with no &#8220;argument&#8221; as a guide through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
wilderness of &#8220;treatment&#8221; to which the subject was
open. This mistake allowed, however, it must be said
that Ole Bull has, genius&#8211;like, refused to misinterpret
the voice within him&#8212;refused to play the charlatan,
and &#8220;bring the house down&#8221;&#8212;<i>as he might well have
done by any kind of &#8220;uttermost,&#8221; from the drums and
trumpets of the orchestra</i>.</p>

<p>The emotion at Niagara is all but mute. It is a
&#8220;small, still voice&#8221; that replies within us to the thunder
of waters. The musical mission of the Norwegian was
to represent the insensate element <i>as it was to him</i>&#8212;to
a human soul, stirred in its seldom reached depths by
the call of power. It was the <i>answer</i> to Niagara that
he endeavored to render in music&#8212;not the <i>call</i>!</p></div>

<p>After his December concerts in New York
Ole Bull returned to Boston, where he gave
several concerts, and revisited some of the New
England towns. He then returned to New
York, to give his last concert in that city for
the season, at the Tabernacle, to an audience of
3500 people.</p>

<p>The criticisms from the papers of that date
would be pronounced as extravagant as Mrs.
Child&#8217;s letters, while her accounts are more vividly
descriptive of the intense excitement which
prevailed. Another quotation from her is therefore
given&#8212;from the letter dated December 24,
1844:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You ask me for my impressions of Ole Bull&#8217;s &#8220;Niagara.&#8221;</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is like asking an Æolian harp to tell what
the great organ of Freyburg does. But since you are
pleased to say that you value my impressions because
they are always my own, and not another person&#8217;s&#8212;because
they are spontaneous, disinterested, and genuine,&#8212;I
will give you the tones as they breathed
through my soul, without anxiety to have them pass for
more than they are worth....</p>

<p>Grand as I thought &#8220;Niagara&#8221; when I first heard it, it
opened upon me with increasing beauty when I heard it
repeated. I then observed many exquisite and graceful
touches, which were lost in the magnitude of the first
impression. The multitudinous sounds are bewildering
in their rich variety.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep.&#8221;</span><br />
<span class="i10">&#8220;The whispering air</span><br />
<span class="i0">Sends inspiration from the rocky heights,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And dark recesses of the caverned rocks;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The little rills, and waters numberless,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Blend their notes with the loud streams.&#8221;</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>There is the pattering of water&#8211;drops, gurglings, twitterings,
and little gushes of song.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;The leaves in myriads jump and spring,</span><br />
<span class="i0">As if, with pipes and music rare,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Some <span class="smcap">Robin Goodfellow</span> were there,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And all the leaves, in festive glee,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Were dancing to the minstrelsy.&#8221;</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>It reminded me of a sentence in the &#8220;Noctes Ambrosianæ,&#8221;
beautifully descriptive of its prevailing character:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>&#8220;It keeps up a bonnie wild musical sough, like that
o&#8217; swarming bees, spring&#8211;startled birds, and the voices
of a hundred streams, some wimpling awa&#8217; ower the
Elysian meadows, and ithers roaring at a distance frae
the clefts.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sublime waterfall is ever present with its echoes,
but present in a calm, contemplative soul. One of the
most poetic minds I know, after listening to this music,
said to me: &#8220;The first time I saw Niagara, I came upon
it through the woods, in the clear sunlight of a summer&#8217;s
morning; and these tones are a perfect transcript
of my emotions!&#8221; In truth, it seems to me a perfect
disembodied poem; a most beautiful mingling of natural
sounds with the reflex of their impressions on a refined
and romantic mind. This serene grandeur, this
pervading beauty, which softens all the greatness, gave
the composition its greatest charm to those who love
poetic expression in music; but it renders it less captivating
to the public in general than they had anticipated.
Had it been called a Pastorale composed within
hearing of Niagara, their preconceived ideas would have
been more in accordance with its calm, bright majesty.</p></div>

<p>She also mentions his &#8220;Prairie Solitude,&#8221; and
says:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A friend acquainted with prairie scenery said it
brought vividly before her those &#8220;dream&#8211;like, bee&#8211;sung,
murmuring, and musical plains.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many who have hitherto been moderate in their enthusiasm
about Ole Bull recognize in these new compositions
more genius than they supposed him to possess.
Tastefully intertwined Fantasias, or those graceful musical
garlands, Rondos, might be supposed to indicate
merely a pleasing degree of talent and skill. But those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
individuals must be hard to convince who do not recognize
the presence of genuine inspiration in the earnest
tenderness of the &#8220;Mother&#8217;s Prayer,&#8221; that sounds as if
it were composed at midnight, alone with the moon; in
the mad, wild life of the &#8220;Tarantella&#8221;; in the fiery,
spirit&#8211;stirring eloquence of the &#8220;<span lang="it">Polacca Guerriera</span>&#8221;;
in the deep spiritual melody of the &#8220;Prairie Solitude&#8221;;
and in the serene majesty of &#8220;Niagara.&#8221;</p>

<p>If I appear to speak with too much decision, it is simply
because my own impressions are distinct and strong,
and I habitually utter them alike without disguise and
without pretension. In the presence of mere skill, I
know not what to say. It may please me somewhat;
but whether it is more or less excellent than some other
thing I cannot tell. But bring me into the presence of
genius, and I know it by rapid intuition as quick as I
know a sunbeam. I cannot tell how I know it. I simply
say, This is genius, as I say, This is a sunbeam.</p>

<p>It is an old dispute, that between genius and criticism,
and probably will never be settled, for it is one of
the manifold forms of conservatism and innovation. In
all departments of life, genius is on the side of progress,
and learning on the side of established order. Genius
comes a Prophet from the future to guide the age onward.
Learning, the Lawgiver, strives to hold it back
upon the past. But the Prophet always revolutionizes
the laws, for thereunto was he sent. Under his powerful
hand, the limitations gradually yield and flow, as
metals melt into new forms at the touch of fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Over everything stands its dæmon, or soul,&#8221; says
Emerson; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>&#8220;and as the <i>form</i> of the thing is reflected to
the eye, so is the <i>soul</i> of the thing reflected by a melody.
The sea, the mountain ridge, Niagara, superexist
in precantations, which sail like odors in the air; and
when any man goes by with ears sufficiently fine, he
overhears them, and endeavors to write them down without
diluting or depraving them.&#8221; Thanks to &#8220;old, ever&#8211;young
Norway,&#8221; she has sent us her finely&#8211;organized
son, to overhear the voices and echoes, and give them
to us in immortal music....</p>

<p>America, in taking the Norwegian minstrel thus
warmly to her heart, receives more than she can give.
His visit has done, and will do, more than any other
cause to waken and extend a love of music throughout
the country; and where love exists, it soon takes form
in science. All things that are alive are born of the
heart.</p></div>

<p>From New York and Brooklyn he went to
Philadelphia, and then, after visiting Louisville
and Wilmington, he returned to New Orleans,
where he gave five concerts in the Great Armory
Hall.</p>

<p>While in New Orleans, he gave a banquet to
his friends at the St. Charles Hotel. Late in the
evening a stranger was announced, who had just
arrived from Europe, Mr. Alexander, the prestidigitateur.
He was cordially received by Ole
Bull. Alexander soon suggested to his host that it
would give him pleasure to entertain the company
with some of his tricks, if, in return, he might hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Ole Bull play. After he had astonished the company
with his sleight&#8211;of&#8211;hand marvels, he turned
to Ole Bull and asked to see the silver medal
presented him in Philadelphia. On opening the
case it was found to contain only a piece of lead;
and when the violin was taken from its case, the
strings were found broken, and the instrument
cracked as it was lifted out. Ole Bull turned
pale, as he feared his own instrument had been
tampered with, but soon discovered that both his
violin and medal were safe. He played far into
the night for his friends, who insisted that they
had not heard him do so well in public.</p>

<p>During the spring and summer months concerts
were given in every place of note in the
Mississippi Valley. The Mammoth Cave in Kentucky
was also visited. At one point in the cave
the artist was too venturesome, and his rashness
nearly cost him his life. He had gone on in advance
of the guide, and was near falling into one
of the subterranean rivers, his light being extinguished
as he crawled through an opening
which at one point seemed too narrow to permit
of his going forward or retreating. Fortunately,
he had scaled the narrow ledge in the darkness,
and was quite unconscious of the chasm on the
verge of which he had been creeping till lights
were brought, when he found that one false move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
would have precipitated him into the depths. He
played in the cave, and the music had a weird,
unearthly sound, as it was echoed through those
eerie, uncanny chambers.</p>

<p>In St. Louis the only concert hall belonged to
a private gentleman. It was lighted by oil lamps,
as gas had not been introduced. A local paper
relates the following incident:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The hall was crowded by the élite of this old French
city; the audience was enjoying the last encore, when
a sudden draught from an open window extinguished
one of the lamps, which, smoking and spluttering, sent
a puff of smoke and soot over Ole Bull&#8217;s face and person.
Absorbed in his performance, he did not notice
what had happened, but having finished, and taken out
his pocket handkerchief to wipe his forehead, alas!&#8212;what
a change was there in the appearance of poor Ole!
His face was black, his pocket handkerchief, his hands,
his violin&#8212;all black! Looking at his violin, he exclaimed,
&#8220;My poor fiddle, I am <i>so</i> sorry for you!&#8221;</p></div>

<p>In October, 1845, Ole Bull returned to New
York and Boston, to give a series of concerts before
his departure for Europe. The knowledge
that he was so soon to leave the country made
the rush for places greater than ever. A new
composition, to the &#8220;Memory of Washington,&#8221; a
descriptive piece, was much liked then, and was
found to be effective when played the last time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
in 1876, in Boston. On the 30th of October he
gave his last concert in New York, in the Broadway
Tabernacle, to an audience of more than
4000 people. The proceeds were given by the
artist to a fund for the widows and orphans of
Masons. During the intermission between the
parts of the programme, he was presented with
the regalia of the Masons of the State of New
York. The Secretary concluded his long presentation
speech with, &#8220;You will be followed by
the &#8216;mother&#8217;s prayer&#8217; and the warm gratitude of
the fatherless.... The world will learn that the
strongest bond is the union of free and honest
men in the indissoluble tie of brotherly love.&#8221;</p>

<p>The warmth of feeling shown by the audience,
in response to the words spoken, deeply touched
Ole Bull. He said in a low voice:&#8212;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;My homage to the memory of Washington is
not mine alone; it is the homage of the whole
Norse folk that is heard through me. The principles
for which this people drew the sword and
shed their blood inspired the Norwegians, and
strengthened them in their struggle for independence.
The admiration of the Norsemen for
American institutions and for their great founder
was early implanted in my breast, and admiration
for Washington and love of liberty were indelibly
impressed upon the tablets of my heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>In November he gave concerts in Philadelphia
and Baltimore, and was just preparing to leave
America when he received a letter signed by the
principal musicians of New York, requesting him
to visit that city once more before he left. He
consented to do so, and appointed the 26th of
November for the concert, to which he invited
all the inmates of the New York Asylum for the
Blind, by the following letter:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="letterhead">
<span class="smcap">Astor House, N. Y.</span>, <i>November 18, 1845</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Friends!</span>&#8212;I have heard that many of you are
fond of music. In a few days I am to leave America,
and if I, before my departure, could afford you some
pleasure, it would be to me a pleasant thing to remember.
If, therefore, all of you, pupils and teachers, will
come and hear me next Wednesday, I will do my best
to entertain you. It would be my greatest desire to
be able for a moment to make you forget that you are
unable to enjoy the beauty of the flowers.</p>

<p class="quotsig">
Your sympathetic friend,<br />
<span class="smcap">Ole B. Bull</span>.
</p>

<p>To the Members of the Asylum for the Blind.</p></div>

<p>This invitation was accepted, and the house
was filled two hours before the performance
began. Among the manifestations of regard he
received from the great audience must be mentioned
a song written for the occasion and sung by
a choir of the pupils from the Blind Asylum, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
an address of thanks. From his first appearance
in the country to the last, he was welcomed with
more than cordiality and kindness. He left the
shores of the New World feeling that his love of
liberty and republican government was strengthened,
though he could not help recognizing their
unequal distribution in the United States. Slavery
could not but be hateful to him; its evil effects
on the whites seemed to him as apparent as
on the blacks.</p>

<p>He wrote to his wife November 30, 1845:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Soon after you receive these lines you will have me
with you. I leave Wednesday, December 3, on the Baltimore
for Havre. There are several reasons for my
preference to go by a sailing vessel. First, its movements
are much pleasanter; you haven&#8217;t the smoke or
jar of the machinery. I shall, too, avoid unpacking my
cases in England; and lastly, I need some rest after
my exertions and late hours. I have been greatly benefited
by my intercourse with noble and distinguished
men and women here. My relation to the Americans
is that of an adopted son.... My farewell concerts in
Boston, in Philadelphia, and especially in New York,
were remarkable for the regret which the people expressed
at my departure, and I was deeply touched.</p></div>

<p>The <i>New York Herald</i> wrote as follows of his
American visit:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The unparalleled enthusiasm awakened by him everywhere
and his popularity in every city were most remarkable.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>He gave his first concert in New York in
the Park Theatre, and the house was crowded; with the
same success he gave six more in the same hall. Then
by the advice of his friends he went to the Tabernacle,
which seats 4000 people, and here too he had a full
house. On one occasion he played to 7000 people for
the American Institute in Niblo&#8217;s Garden.</p>

<p>From New York, Ole Bull traveled through the
United States and Canada and a part of the West Indies,
and everywhere called forth the same tremendous
enthusiasm and overwhelming joy. He traveled in
these countries more than 100,000 miles, and played in
every city of importance. From his first landing till his
departure he gave over 200 concerts, of which some
netted him only $200, while others, as for instance
those in New York, netted him over $3000. Estimating
them as low as $400 on the average, his concerts
must have given him a profit of $80,000. Besides he
contributed more than $20,000 by concerts to charitable
institutions, and to artists who assisted him he paid
$15,000.</p>

<p>No artist has ever visited our country and received
so many honors. Poems by the hundred have been
written to him; gold vases, jewels, medals, etc., have
been presented to him by various corporations. His
whole remarkable appearance in this country is really
unexampled in glory and fame. He came from Norway,
the most northern country of Europe, the birthplace
of Odin, and inspired all America. His tender
farewell composition in New York made the tears come
to many eyes.... After having thus for over two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
years won triumph upon triumph and an abundance of
gold and fame in the New World, Ole Bull left on December
3d for Havre, whence he intended to go to
Paris....</p></div>

<p>Mrs. Child&#8217;s and Mrs. Botta&#8217;s good&#8211;byes seem
most fitting to close this account of Ole Bull&#8217;s
first American trip. The former is as follows:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Where on this planet is a place so sublimely appropriate
as the rocky coast of Norway, to the newly&#8211;invented
Æolian sea&#8211;signals? Metal pipes, attached to
floating buoys, are placed among the breakers, and
through these do the winds lift their warning voices,
louder and louder, as the sea rages more and more
fiercely. Here is a magnificent storm&#8211;organ, on which
to play, &#8220;Wind of the winter night, whence comest
thou?&#8221;</p>

<p>On this coast has Ole Bull, from childhood, heard the
waves roar their mighty bass to the shrill soprano of
the winds, and has seen it all subside into sun&#8211;flecked,
rippling silence. There, in view of lofty mountains, sea&#8211;circled
shores, and calm, deep, blue fjords, shut in by
black precipices and tall green forests, has he listened
to &#8220;the fresh mighty throbbings of the heart of Nature.&#8221;
Had he lived in the sunny regions of Greece or Italy,
instead of sea&#8211;girt Norway, with its piled&#8211;up mountains,
and thundering avalanches, and roaring waterfalls, and
glancing auroras, and the shrill whispering of the northern
wind through broad forests of pines, I doubt whether
his violin could ever have discoursed such tumultuous
life, or lulled itself to rest with such deep&#8211;breathing tenderness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>I know not what significance the Nordmen have in
the world&#8217;s spiritual history; but it must be deep. Our
much boasted Anglo&#8211;Saxon blood is but a rivulet from
the great Scandinavian sea. The Teutonic language,
&#8220;with its powerful primeval words&#8212;keys to the being
of things&#8221;&#8212;is said by the learned to have come from
the East, the source from which both light and truth
dawned upon the world. This language has everywhere
mixed itself with modern tongues, and forms the bone
and nerve of our own. To these Nordmen, with their
deep reverence, their strong simplicity, their wild, struggle&#8211;loving
will, we owe the invention of the organ, and
of Gothic architecture. In these modern times, they
have sent us Swedenborg, that deep in&#8211;seeing prophet,
as yet imperfectly understood, either by disciples or
opponents; and Frederika Bremer, gliding like sun&#8211;warmth
into the hearts of many nations; and Thorwaldsen,
with his serene power and majestic grace; and
Beethoven, with aspirations that leap forth beyond the
&#8220;flaming bounds of time and space;&#8221; and Ole Bull,
with the primeval harmonies of creation vibrating
through his soul in infinite variations. Reverence to
the Nordmen; for assuredly their strong free utterance
comes to us from the very <i>heart</i> of things....</p>

<p>Wordsworth thus describes the young maiden, to
whom Nature was &#8220;both law and impulse:&#8221;&#8212;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&#8220;She shall lean her ear</span><br />
<span class="i4">In many a secret place,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Where rivulets dance their wayward round,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And Beauty, born of murmuring sound,</span><br />
<span class="i4">Shall pass into her face.&#8221;</span><br />
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>The engraved likeness of Ole Bull often reminds me
of these lines. It seems listening to one of his own
sweet strains of melody, passing away, away,&#8212;and vanishing
into the common air, fine as the mist scattered
afar by the fountains. The effect, thus transmitted in
form by the artist, reproduces its cause again; for, as I
look upon it, a whirling spray of sound goes dancing
through my memory, to the clink of fairy castanets.
When I look at Domenichino&#8217;s &#8220;Cumæan Sibyl,&#8221; and
Allston&#8217;s wonderful picture of the &#8220;Lady Hearing Music,&#8221;
my soul involuntarily listens, and sometimes hears
faint, wandering strains of melody....</p>

<p>This spiritual expression of music is heard in very
different degrees by different people, and by some not
at all. One man remarked, as he left Ole Bull&#8217;s concert,
&#8220;Well, there is no such thing as getting a dollar&#8217;s
worth of music out of a fiddle, in three hours.&#8221; Of the
same concert, a man of thorough musical science, and
deep feeling for his musical art, writes to me thus:
&#8220;Ole Bull has certainly impressed me as no man ever
impressed me before. The most glorious sensation I
ever had was to sit in one of his audiences, and feel
that all were elevated to the same pitch with myself.
My impulse was to speak to every one as to an intimate
friend. The most indifferent person was a living soul
to me. The most remote or proud I did not fear or despise.
In that element they were all accessible, nay, all
worth reaching. This surely was the highest testimony
to his great art and his great soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>An eloquent writer, who publishes under the fictitious
signature of &#8220;John Waters,&#8221; describes his first impressions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
of Liszt&#8217;s piano&#8211;playing, with an enthusiasm that
would doubtless seem very ridiculous to many who listened
to the same sounds. He says that, &#8220;with blow
after blow upon the instrument with his whole force, he
planted large columnar masses of sound, like the Giant&#8217;s
Causeway. The instrument rained, hailed, thundered,
moaned, whistled, shrieked round those basaltic columns,
in every cry that the tempest can utter in its
wildest paroxysms of wrath.... Then we were borne
along, through countless beauties of rock and sky and
foliage, to a grotto, by the side of which was a fountain
that seemed one of the Eyes of the Earth, so large and
darkly brilliant was it, so deep and so serene. Here we
listened to the voices rather than the songs of birds,
when the music by degrees diminished and ceased.&#8221;</p>

<p>A lady to whom he spoke of the concert acknowledged
that the sounds had brought up very similar
pictures to her soul; but probably not ten of the large
audience listened in such a spirit. That it was thus received
by <i>any</i>, shows that it was <i>in</i> the music, whether
the composer was aware of it or not; and genius only
can produce those magical effects, even on a few.</p>

<p>To Him who made the ear a medium of pleasure to
the soul, I am humbly grateful for delight in sweet
sounds; and still more deeply am I grateful that the
spiritual sense of music is more and more opened to me.
I have joy in the consciousness of growth, as I can imagine
a flower might be pleased to feel itself unfolding
and expanding to the sunlight. This <i>expressiveness</i> of
music no man ever revealed to me like Ole Bull, and
therefore, in my joy and gratitude, I strive, like a delighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
child, to bring all manner of garlands and jewels
wherewith to crown his genius.</p>

<p>Here is a wreath of wild flowers to welcome his return:&#8212;</p>

<p>The wife and children of Ole Bull awaited his
coming in Paris. His letters make frequent mention
of his children, for whom he had many pet
names, and he delighted to tell his friends about
them. In one of his last letters from New York
he said:&#8212;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have dreamed of Alexander and Thorvald, and my
soul is filled with grief&#8212;for they would not recognize
me.... I must play to&#8211;morrow, and this kills one.<a name="Anchor-14" id="Anchor-14"></a><a href="#Footnote-14" class="Anchor" title="Go to footnote 14.">[14]</a>
I shall soon come to you myself, and you will hear more
from my own lips than I will trust to this cold paper.</p></div>

<p>It is easy to imagine the pleasure of the meeting,&#8212;and
also the pain, since he could not yet
feel that his independence was sufficiently secured
to justify him in giving up his professional tours.
He had not received the proportion of the returns
from his two years&#8217; work that was fairly his due.
He had left, as he habitually did, his business
settlements till the last moment, and often trusted
his funds in what proved to be unsafe hands. As
a consequence, he was still obliged to think of the
pecuniary results of his work.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1846 he appeared several times
in Paris, and on the 19th of April he gave a concert
at the Italian Opera. The following is an
extract from an advance notice in the <i>Corsaire
Satan</i>, of the 15th of April:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Each year public opinion, having fluttered about for
a time, at last settles upon an artist, who, to use an
English phrase, becomes the lion of the season. This
happy advantage has been accorded this year to Ole
Bull. After the extraordinary success which he had
attained at Roger&#8217;s entertainments, he could not leave
Paris without giving a grand concert at the Théâtre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Italien. This is a custom made fashionable by Liszt,
Thalberg, Madame Pleyel,&#8212;in fact, by all great artists;
a fashion which some lesser stars with more boldness
than success have followed. Ole Bull was not too sanguine
in regard to his strength, for all the tickets are already
sold. This part of the problem has been solved;
to solve the other half he only needs to play, as he has
done at the Grand Opéra, and the Opéra Comique, and
his victory will be both brilliant and complete....
Ole Bull&#8217;s violin does not pipe and shriek like those of
some of his confrères, who whine when they pretend to
sing; his bow really possesses something magic and
inspired. It is the human voice in its most exalted
expression.</p></div>

<p>The following criticism of the performance, by
P. A. Fiorentino, appeared in <i>Le Constitutionnel</i>
for the 22d of April:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ole Bull has given a grand concert at the Théâtre
Italien. All the Norse courage and daring was needed
in venturing to offer the public a very battle of five
violin pieces. What fire and what power! But a favorable
result justifies the greatest rashness, and Ole Bull,
in the course of the evening, showed us that he was
not over&#8211;sanguine in regard to his powers. He first
played variations of a diabolic difficulty and originality
on Bellini&#8217;s aria: &#8220;L&#8217;amo, ah, l&#8217;amo, e m&#8217;è più cara.&#8221;
It was as if the spirits of hell, sunk in dark despair,
must love and long for the light of heaven. Paganini&#8217;s
&#8220;Carnival,&#8221; which, as by magic, carries us to <i>Via del
Corso</i>, in the very midst of the ringing laughter and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
joyful abandon of the Maccolettians, was repeated at
the emphatic demand of the audience. &#8220;A Mother&#8217;s
Prayer,&#8221; composed by the artist beneath the quiet
arches of the cloister of Santa Maria, is a great and
severe piece, full of mystic tenderness and religious
warmth. Finally, the &#8220;<span lang="it">Polacca Guerriera</span>,&#8221; which we
had twice heard before, seemed to us more and more to
merit the enthusiastic reception the public is everywhere
giving it. Ole Bull sang splendidly last night. He was
applauded and recalled so many times, that he might
have believed himself in Venice, Florence, or Naples.</p></div>

<p>In May Ole Bull was playing in Bordeaux, to
the rapturous applause of that city. Before his
departure, he gave a banquet at the Hotel de la
Paix, to which the <i>Courrier de la Gironde</i> refers as
follows:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The apartments which Ibrahim Pacha had occupied
a fortnight previous were fitted up for the occasion,
and were truly regal in the elegance of their appointments.
The large salon, especially, was dazzling; and
the brilliant toilets of the fairest ladies of the city
heightened the effect, as they clustered about the piano.
All persons in Bordeaux distinguished for talent, rank,
or wealth, participated in the reception. A quintette,
by Mozart, was played by the artist with our ablest
amateurs, and a duet for piano and violin, by Mayseder,
was accompanied by a lady. Compositions and improvisations
of the violinist followed. As a host, Ole Bull
was a prince; one of the most distinguished ladies present
remarked, when she saw him receive with the exquisite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
courtesy and aristocratic charm of manner peculiarly
his own, that Ole Bull seemed to her that evening
a second Count of Monte Christo.... No artist
has ever been received with so much distinction and
enthusiasm in Bordeaux.</p></div>

<p>At the end of the month he filled a most successful
engagement in Toulouse, where a <i>fête lyrique</i>
was given in his honor by the residents of
that city at the Théâtre du Capitole. In Lyons
he gave a concert for the benefit of a poor actress,
who, friendless, and unable to obtain an
engagement, had been driven in her despair to
attempt suicide.</p>

<p>In July he appeared in Marseilles, where he had
full houses, although he complains in his letters
that, as his concerts had not been well announced
or arranged in advance, his profits were less than
they should have been. His financial success
could not always be measured by his artistic triumphs.
The Marseilles <i>Le Sud</i> said of him:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>His place is between Paganini and Liszt. If we were
asked what distinction we would make between the
young Norse artist and the immortal Genoese virtuoso,
we should answer, that, so far as talent is concerned,
the question is a difficult one. Who among us remembers
with sufficient distinctness the marvels performed
by Paganini&#8217;s bow in this place ten years ago, to be able
to determine with exactness whether Ole Bull overcomes
equally great difficulties? It is possible that at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
certain moments Paganini&#8217;s manner was even more
wonderful and powerful; but nothing is more certain
than that Ole Bull is his equal, if not his superior, in
beauty, warmth, tenderness, and variety. When, on the
other hand, we leave out of the account purely technical
questions, which even artists themselves cannot
decide, it must be admitted that admiration is more
readily accorded to the frank, modest, unselfish young
man, who has given evidence, in many ways, of an exalted
nobility of character....</p>

<p>A no less electric enthusiasm broke forth again and
again, when the artist played the &#8220;Carnival of Venice,&#8221;&#8212;his
own variations. One can hardly imagine with
what power of originality Ole Bull has mastered this
favorite theme of Paganini&#8217;s. He is especially brilliant
in the humorous part. If we remember right, Paganini
did not produce that natural and gushing sprightliness
in the conversation between Punchinello and the policeman.
It is strange enough, that the Northman has been
able to put more sly cunning and rollicking fun into
the scene than the Italian Mephistopheles. Ole Bull
ends this composition with a bird&#8211;song, which is the
most surprising imitation one can imagine. Here his
instrument is no more a violin, but a gathering of the
most charming song&#8211;birds.</p></div>

<p>Ole Bull here met frequently with his friend
Hans Andersen, who was visiting Marseilles.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1847 he crossed the Mediterranean
to Algiers, joining his friend General
Youssuf, and they had many an exciting adventure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
on their journey across the desert. He had
his violin with him and played for the officers in
the little town of Milianah. His audience was a
singularly mixed one, being composed of Europeans,
Arabs, and negroes; and the expressions
of admiration or wide&#8211;mouthed astonishment
which followed his playing were in keeping. The
violin case had been given by General Youssuf,
with strict instructions, to the keeping of two
Arabs; they regarded it with a holy awe, and
handled it with the greatest care, too proud of
their trust to permit any one to come near it.</p>

<p>From Algiers the artist went to Spain. The
melodies and songs of that country charmed him,
and he declared them to be the most beautiful in
the world. He was delighted too with the language,
and often spoke of its admirable adaptiveness
to express the finest shadings of thought,
combined with strength and sonorousness.</p>

<p>During the festivities attending the marriage
of Isabella II. with Francisco d&#8217;Assiz, and Donna
Fernanda with the Duc de Montpensier, he gave
concerts in Madrid. He composed by request
&#8220;La Verbena de San Juan,&#8221; which he dedicated
to the Queen, who offered him a general&#8217;s commission.
She thought, no doubt, that the brilliant
dress of a staff&#8211;officer would become him, but
he declined the honor. Her majesty presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
him a flower composed of one hundred and forty
brilliants in the form of a verbena, and the order
of Charles III. in brilliants; also the Portuguese
order of Christus.</p>

<p>From a long notice in the <i lang="es">Español</i> of the 15th
of October the following is taken:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is now fifteen years since we heard Ole Bull for
the first time in Paris. He was very young then, but
gave promise of becoming what he now is, a great
violinist. We also knew Paganini, and can assure our
readers that of all the violinists we have heard, Ole Bull
nearest approaches him in his performance. Besides
his wonderful execution, only to be accomplished by
an arm of iron like his, he draws from his instrument
a powerful and vigorous tone; he plays the andante
to perfection, and besides clearness and precision he
makes his instrument sing, a quality without which all
his other accomplishments would be colorless. This
violinist has created the greatest sensation ever known
in Madrid; and his triumph is all the greater for coming
as he did unheralded by the trumpets of fame. He
has performed pieces of great length, which were not
fantasias or variations on known operas, of which the
Spanish are fond; and as instrumental concerts are not
much liked here, we feared that the efforts and skill
of Ole Bull would not be duly recompensed; but his
immense talent very soon commanded the sympathies
of the public and compelled their applause. The Norwegian
artist deserves no less praise as a composer than
as a performer. His great &#8220;Concerto&#8221; has all the
severity and qualities of that form of composition....</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>The following is from the Valencia <i lang="es">Fenix</i> of
June 27, 1847:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The violin in Ole Bull&#8217;s hands is a perfect orchestra,
and an impetuous torrent of delightful harmonies; it
seems as if the strings multiply themselves, and, obedient
to the inspiration of the artist, they as well imitate
the human voice as the trumpet of the warrior, the
song of the maiden, or the lyre of the poet. We have
heard nothing so magical, seducing, and astonishing.</p>

<p>The delirious public offered him an ovation such as
no other artist had received here before....</p></div>

<p>From Spain he returned to Paris, bringing
with him seven pictures by old Spanish masters,
one of them from the 10th century, and two fine
violins. <i>En route</i>, he gave concerts in Bordeaux
and Nantes. His letters spoke of the Spaniards,
their music, their boundless hospitality, and the
dangers of travel in the mountains on account of
bandits. Because of this he returned by sea to
Marseilles, and rejoined his wife, spending with
her some months in the country, at St. Michel,
near Paris.</p>

<p>During the revolution of 1848, he went, at the
head of the Norwegians in Paris, to the Palais de
Justice, and presented a Norwegian flag to President
Lamartine, with an address, as evidence of
their sympathy. This flag was preserved in the
Hotel de Ville till that building was destroyed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the Commune in 1871. He also gave a concert
in Paris for the wounded of the revolution.</p>

<p>He remained in that city most of the summer,
working upon and studying the construction of
the violin, with his friend, the great violin&#8211;maker
Vuillaume. The following extract from a letter
of Vuillaume&#8217;s may be of interest here:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Since you left us so long ago, I have wished twenty
times to write to you. I have had many things of all
sorts to tell you&#8212;very important, as you may imagine,
and which I have promised myself much pleasure in
communicating. Something or other has always prevented
my doing this; but to&#8211;day here I am in the
country for four hours, and I improve the opportunity
to chat with you....</p>

<p>You are aware that my daughter Emilie is married to
Alard, and we are all well pleased with the match. You
do not know him, but when you come you shall make
his acquaintance....</p>

<p>When you were in Paris I showed you some instruments
with which I had taken extraordinary pains, and
you liked them. I have since kept up this kind of work,
and had made some quartettes and double&#8211;basses for
the Exposition; but finding nothing novel in all this
finished work, I resolved to make something colossal&#8212;an
<i>octobasse</i>! It is the giant of bow instruments. I
have never seen nor heard of anything like it. It is
made exactly, in all its proportions, like a double&#8211;bass,
but it is twelve feet in height. It is strung with three
enormous chords, which give the notes <i>re</i>, <i>sol</i>, <i>ut</i>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
sound is clear, deep, and sonorous, nothing at all like
the dull and thick tone of the ordinary double&#8211;bass.
The fingering is done by means of mechanism connected
with keys at the lower end of the finger&#8211;board,
which the performer, standing on a stool, easily reaches
with the left hand, while with the right he draws a big
bow across the strings. The use of this instrument
must be reserved for the grander effects of harmony.
It is like the sub&#8211;bass of the organ. I believe I have
added a new and powerful voice to the family of instruments....</p>

<p>Give me some news of yourself, of your family, of
your plans, what your children are doing&#8212;all this will
interest me....</p>

<p>I have just arranged a room for my collection of old
instruments. I have already many interesting specimens,
to which I shall add as occasion offers. The finish
and the furniture of the room are all in old carved
oak of the time of Francis I.... You see I am not
afraid of tiring you with all these details. I hope to
bore you still more in showing you all my relics when
you come....</p></div>

<p>In October Ole Bull returned to Norway and
bought a place near Christiansand, having decided
to remain for a time in his own country. He gave
many concerts, and was everywhere enthusiastically
received. His success determined him to
attempt to found a National Theatre. The country
had, up to that time, depended upon Danish
plays, Danish actors, and Danish musicians. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
wanted a national drama and the national music,
and for this he spent his money and his time
without stint.</p>

<p>It should be remarked, perhaps, here, that Ole
Bull was too apt to consider that loyalty to an
undertaking meant a confidence and interest so
entire as not only to demand the giving all that
he had, but often the burning of his ships behind
him in the neglect of his own legitimate work. It
was characteristic of him all his life, to stake all
without reserve, and to feel that he could not hope
for success unless he was willing to do this. His
great undertakings, as a rule, failed only in their
benefit to himself. Almost without exception, they
have resulted in permanent good, and that which
lay nearest his heart he lived to see recognized
by his countrymen. The seed of national feeling
and national dramatic and musical work he had
planted grew in his time, and bore the best fruit.
Jonas Lie says:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>With all the influence which his mighty name gave
him, Ole Bull demanded the realization of a national
drama. What Waldemar Thrane had begun in his Norse
Opera should be continued in a development of the national
music; whatever of dramatic art had been previously
borrowed from Denmark should be replaced by
what was purely Norwegian. Beside the current which
swept through the country from the French Revolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
at that time, there were other circumstances which also
tended to awaken a national feeling, since, beside Ole
Bull, there were several Norse painters at home, because
of the troubles abroad. Among these were Tidemand and
Gude. To these exiled artists, the return home was like
a re&#8211;baptism of patriotism, and their presence inspired
the people in their turn. The air was filled with ideal demands,
and a movement was inaugurated which marked
an epoch in our National Art, as well as in the development
of our literature.</p>

<p>A Norse theatre with a Norse orchestra was what Ole
Bull, in his enthusiasm, determined to realize in his birthplace,
Bergen. He appointed committees, engaged actors,
built and furnished a theatre. He himself led the
orchestra, worked up public sentiment, and inspired the
press, until at last, on the 2d of January, 1850, his National
Theatre was opened with a representation which
was acknowledged, by his opponents even, to have been
a surprising success.<a name="Anchor-15" id="Anchor-15"></a><a href="#Footnote-15" class="Anchor" title="Go to footnote 15.">[15]</a></p>

<p>The hasty, animated lines which he wrote to his wife
that day, in which he mentions his exertions, his many
disappointments, and his persevering, energetic hope
for the undertaking, strike one very forcibly.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>
<p>The selection of plays was restricted, since
they were necessarily adapted to the limited powers
of the actors. Ole Bull conducted the orchestra
and played, as did also his friend, Möllar&#8211;gutten,
or Thorgeir Andunson of Haukelid&#8211;Rock.
Mr. Goldschmidt thus speaks of this peasant&#8211;violinist,
celebrated all over Norway:<a name="Anchor-16" id="Anchor-16"></a><a href="#Footnote-16" class="Anchor" title="Go to footnote 16.">[16]</a>&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He used to play at dancing parties, and in him many
of the old legends, pointing to the demoniac power of
music, were revived. In order to understand this, one
must have seen the national dances of Norway&#8212;the
Halling&#8211;dance especially. It commences with a slow,
majestic measure, and it is surprising to see with what
dignity and grace the powerful forms of old and young
move; by degrees it becomes quicker, the elder folk
retire, and at last it turns into a leaping dance, which
only the strongest young people can safely perform,
and during which formidable leaps are executed by
the lads.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Oh, never talk again to me</span><br />
<span class="i0">Of Spanish girls and Southern dancers,&#8221;</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>you would say, paraphrasing Byron, if you saw this
passionate, frantic, though serious and chaste dance,
that exhibits the fierce, martial spirit of Norwegian
youth. It once happened that, whilst the dance whirled
to the wild, fiery music&#8212;to the strain proceeding, as it
were, from the depths of earth, from the foaming waterfall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
from the howling tempest of the mountains&#8212;the
knives of the lads &#8220;became loose in their sheaths,&#8221; and
blood flowed along the floor. The cellar&#8211;man, on proceeding
to the cellar to bring up beer, saw seated behind
a hogshead Old Nick himself playing the fiddle;
then, understanding why blood flowed so freely above,
he came up and cried out: &#8220;Stop your ears, the devil
plays the fiddle!&#8221; Well, it was said that Thorgeir Andunson
could play in like manner, having on his lonely
rock of Haukelid learnt it from the spirit reigning in
the foaming river below, although his appearance was
quiet and gentle and frequently sad. He had married
a girl of the same station of life as himself, but always
looked up to her as to a peculiar being that had descended
to him. Being once asked what was his ambition
in life, he answered: &#8220;To be able to buy a pair of
shoes and a silk neckerchief for my wife.&#8221; Having
heard of Ole Bull, he came to pay him a visit, and was
quite bewildered when he heard one of Mozart&#8217;s compositions.
&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;this is music!&#8221; and strolling
about the garden all night, tried to play it from
memory; but in his hands it turned into mere Halling&#8211;dance.
His fine sense showed him in Ole Bull the
happier artist, and far from envying, he attached himself
to him with a kind of devotion that proved itself
afterwards when the violinist established at Bergen the
first Norwegian theatre. When the messenger came
to Thorgeir, bidding him to gird his loins, and come
down to play before a public, the shy artist overcame
his bashfulness, and followed the messenger at once,
&#8220;for I must do something to see and hear Ole.&#8221; The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
farmers along the mountain road, meanwhile, having
heard the tidings that Thorgeir was going to Ole to
establish an independent Norse theatre, gave him a
mounted escort as a prince. One great farmer, a descendant
of the old kings, wished to retain Thorgeir for
a night to give a <i>soirée</i>, as we should say, and on Thorgeir
declining and escaping from his house,&#8212;&#8220;for Ole
expects me at the Norse theatre,&#8221;&#8212;it nearly came to
a battle between the squads, which was prevented by
Thorgeir&#8217;s solemn promise that he would return and
play to the dancers &#8220;three entire nights.&#8221; He returned
home a wealthy man. Ole Bull had made him
earn 2000 specie dollars (about £400),&#8212;an immense
fortune for the fiddler on Haukelid&#8211;Rock.</p>

<p>Let me be permitted, before I leave Thorgeir Andunson,
to add a few words about the popular music
of Norway, which, the dance music included, is most
intimately connected with the old ballads, often instead
of instrumental music accompanying the dance, and
of a peculiarly sweet, romantic character. There are
myriads of these ballads, but I will select only a few.
A girl meets the elf&#8211;king, who sings so enchantingly
to her that she follows him to the mountain, which
opens itself and closes again when they have entered.
The girl&#8217;s father, hearing in the forest his daughter&#8217;s
plaintive call for help, hastens to the spot. If the
church bell be rung by the mountain until sunset, the
elf&#8211;folks must give up their prey; so the bell is taken
down from the steeple, and, with the assistance of all
the village, brought to the mountain and set in motion.
Already is the sun near setting, when the rope breaks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
and the girl has disappeared forever. Now, at the risk
of being taxed with exaggeration, I assert that through
this music is heard, or felt, the demoniac power of the
elf&#8211;folks; at the same time there is a wail for the loss
of the girl, as if all the tender, sweet attraction of love
between man and woman, all the delicacy, yearning,
and devotion which man can feel, were challenged by
the outrage committed on the girl.</p>

<p>An old <span lang="no">Odelsbonde</span>, renowned for his strength, would
only marry his daughter to a lad who could overcome
him in wrestling; a handsome youth, whose daring and
love are stronger than his awe of the mighty <span lang="no">Odelsbonde</span>,
comes to woo and wrestle. With incomparable,
simple, patriarchal grace the <span lang="no">Odelsbonde</span> arises from
his <i>Höisæde</i> (chair of honor), and, waving his hand, bids
the wooer welcome; after which, descending the steps
into the middle of the hall, he calmly begins the wrestling
match. By degrees the combat becomes animated,
and the wrestlers hot and passionate, each adversary
forgetting in the struggle the object of it&#8212;the trembling
girl; at last the old giant, lifting the youth up
above his head, flings him down at his feet, a corpse.
The music, which has marvelously expressed the incidents
of the story throughout, here stops short with a
wail of terror and compassion; and I assure you at the
last note your brow will be moist, and if not ashamed
of your weakness you will admit that you tremble with
emotion. [I allude not to the old song only, but to Ole
Bull&#8217;s composition.]</p>

<p>Lastly, I will give only a short legend. A lad, a violin
player, unable to conquer the instrument and elicit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
from it what he had on his heart, held its apertures to
the mouth of his dying mother, and from that time people,
when he played, stood spell&#8211;bound, listening with
heart and soul to tones not of this world. When Ole
Bull went forth to the world, his mother, old Norway,
had breathed into his violin, but not her last breath;
the spell that bound his listeners had in it something
healthy and cheerful joined with its magic power.</p></div>

<p>From the outside districts Ole Bull brought
peasants to perform the national dances in his
theatre. Thus the first winter passed, and the
summer was spent in preparing with all possible
energy for the next season; the actors and musicians
worked <i>con amore</i>, and success rewarded
them; the theatre could now stand on its own
merits. After the enterprise had progressed so
far, Ole Bull asked of the Storthing, in 1851, a
yearly appropriation to ensure its perpetuity.
His aim was not alone to secure a certain sum
for the establishment of a permanent dramatic
school, but he desired a public acknowledgment
of the National Theatre itself. His petition was
refused by a small majority. This grieved him,
and, together with other troubles growing out
of the management, made him, to a degree, lose
heart and courage.</p>

<p>But now the Norse students determined to do
all in their power to give him the desired public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
approval; with the aid of citizens, representing all
classes of society and interests, they arranged a
great musical festival in Christiania for the benefit
of the Bergen Theatre. This gave Ole Bull
a new impulse. He composed a chorus for male
voices, which was sung after the prologue, and
played several numbers on that occasion with
brilliant success. Later in the evening a &#8220;Sexa&#8221;
was given in his honor, and those present were
touched to see the happiness he felt in the acknowledgment
and acceptance of his pet idea in
the Norwegian capital. On his return to Bergen
a dramatic performance was given at his suggestion
for the University Building Fund in Christiania,
in recognition of the sympathy the students
had so substantially shown the theatre.<a name="Anchor-17" id="Anchor-17"></a><a href="#Footnote-17" class="Anchor" title="Go to footnote 17.">[17]</a></p>

<p>Winter Hjelm, who has supplied many of these
details, continues:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It was not alone the Norse Theatre to which Ole
Bull gave thousands of dollars, but every public enterprise
of importance was aided liberally by him. He
assisted Tidemand and Gude at this time in a series of
entertainments given for the benefit of young artists
kept at home by the troubles abroad.</p></div>

<p>The theatre was too great an undertaking for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
one man to carry. Ole Bull not only lost much
money, but he became involved in controversies
and lawsuits with the authorities. It will be
readily understood that the Norse national feeling
he worked for and inspired was unpopular with
those who represented the established order of
things, and that every possible advantage was
seized upon to annoy and harass him. He, as
usual, left points open to his adversaries.</p>

<p>On the opening of the theatre the police officials
thought that not only they themselves but
their assistants (a term which they would have
interpreted broadly enough to include their families)
should have had tickets presented to them;
and they threatened to take measures for closing
the theatre if their claims were not conceded.
Ole Bull then asked and received their demands
in writing. They claimed three permanent, reserved
seats for the master, adjutant, and attorney
of the police, and more when desired for
their assistants; the seats to have a view of stage
and audience, and to be chosen before the sale
was open to the public. This stupid demand the
violinist met with ridicule. He reserved the seats
asked for, but hung above them a placard with
the inscription in large black letters, &#8220;Seats for
the Police,&#8221; and over this a large green lantern
to light the placard. For this offense the officials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
called him to answer in court; and the case being
decided against him he carried it up to the Supreme
Court. The distinguished advocate to the
crown, Mr. Duncker, an intimate friend of Ole
Bull, asked the privilege of acting as his counsel.
The appeal was argued in Christiania. Mr.
Duncker took the ground that the granting of
the seats was a courtesy and not a legal obligation.
He indulged in much sarcasm and ridicule
at the expense of the complaining officials,
and concluded thus: &#8220;Who does not feel that
in Ole Bull&#8217;s person art and genius have been
offered a grievous insult for which the police of
Bergen will never be able to atone? But the
satisfaction which the court can give will, I am
confident, be granted to Ole Bull.&#8221; The case
was decided in his favor, but not a newspaper in
the kingdom dared report the defeat of a government
official; and the able defense of Mr.
Duncker was printed in Copenhagen by the
<i>North and South</i>, which said: &#8220;We gladly offer
our columns to print Mr. Duncker&#8217;s defense for
circulation in Norway, that such a man as Ole
Bull may receive the satisfaction due him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The police officials were naturally irritated at
the result of this suit, and watched for opportunities
of annoying him. On one occasion he was
called upon, under an obsolete municipal regulation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
to answer the charge of smoking a cigar in
the street in Bergen, as the law allowed only
covered pipes to be smoked on the streets. The
judge and officers of the court being most of
them old friends or former school comrades, the
trial was very amusing. The violinist entered
the court room, and having in the most courteous
and natural manner offered the judge and officers
each a cigar, which of course each declined, he
lighted his own, remarking that he had not had
time at so early an hour to enjoy his regular
morning smoke. He was soon acquitted, as it
was found that the indictment against him was
for smoking &#8220;in the square,&#8221; whereas the regulation
forbade it only on the <i>streets</i>.</p>

<p>On another occasion, when he was called to
answer a charge of the same trivial character, he
happened to be summoned to appear in court on
the morning of his birthday, the 5th of February,
an occasion for visits of congratulation in Norway.
A great crowd of his friends, not finding
him at home and learning where he was, assembled
outside the court&#8211;house. Among the
number were many peasants who had come in
from the country to express their good wishes.
During the forenoon the thousands in the streets
became so clamorous for his appearance, to tell
them what treatment he was receiving, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
officials were much disturbed. Although requested
by the judge to speak to the crowd, the
artist declined to do so; but at last the excitement
became so intense that at the urgent entreaty
of this official he took his arm and walked
home to dinner with him, to satisfy and quiet the
people.</p>

<p>The children even were interested in these
contests, and would accompany Ole Bull to and
from the theatre by hundreds, while they took
every occasion to torment his annoyers. The affection
always shown him by the children of Bergen
touched him more than any demonstration
on the part of their elders.</p>

<p>Jonas Lie, referring to the establishment of the
theatre, says:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The culture of the country which had fostered his
Norse violin was not yet sufficiently advanced for the
new step. After two years the theatre passed into
other hands, but the 2d of January, 1850, will always be
regarded as the birthday of the Norse National Drama
and a memorable day in Ole Bull&#8217;s life. Johannes
Brun, Mrs. Gundersen, Mrs. Brun, Mrs. Wolf, and Mrs.
Juel,&#8212;these artists who have since shed so much lustre
on our National Theatre at the capital,&#8212;all began
their artistic careers in Ole Bull&#8217;s theatre.</p></div>

<p>In the disappointments and heartaches which
the artist suffered from the misunderstanding of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
his best motives and most unselfish efforts,
should not be forgotten the sympathy and helpfulness
of the men and women of whom Norway
is proud to&#8211;day. A few letters of this time have
been preserved.</p>

<p>The following must have given him new courage
and stimulus:&#8212;</p>

<span class="smcap">Balestrand</span>,<a name="Anchor-18" id="Anchor-18"></a><a href="#Footnote-18" class="Anchor" title="Go to footnote 18.">[18]</a> <i>September 4, 1849</i>.
</p>

<p>... As I am not certain to meet you in Christiania
when I go there, I write a few words to tell you what
a lively interest I feel in your grand undertaking, the
laying of the corner&#8211;stone of a <i>Norse</i> theatre. And
next, I have a strong desire to thank you for the happy
hours you made me pass when we were last together.
It would not do for everybody to express their gratitude
by letter, but my artistic conceit makes me feel that the
good I gained from your playing was of another kind
than that which most people received; but, be that as
it may, I have often thought that I must write and
thank you some time, and this present occasion is a
good one, since this is to be a sort of business letter.
I have studied to find if there was not some way I could
give my mite to this important work. In any case my
suggestion can do no harm if it should not be practicable.
I am thinking naturally of painting&#8212;the decorations.
The manner in which this should be done is no
unimportant matter, and especially important is it that
it should be done by a Norseman and be Norse in
spirit. As I am pretty certain not to be depriving any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
fellow&#8211;countrymen of work, I offer my services. The
theatre must pay for the canvas and colors, or we might
procure them in some other way that may occur to us
later. You will best know how the directors would receive
my offer. This much is certain, that it would
give me great pleasure to work for the young theatre
in this way. I could have the help of some of the
younger artists in Christiania, as it would be too hard a
task for me alone. It will be delightful if we can talk
this over a fortnight hence in Christiania. The work
you have before you will demand courage and endurance,
and I wish you enough of both, since of necessity
many serious obstacles will surely come in your
way. Therefore good courage!&#8212;as the song says. I
am living amid all this glory and beauty, and know not
whether to be sad or happy; for it is in every way delightful,
but&#8212;what will come of it? The summer joy
will soon be past, as already I must light my fire of an
evening as I sit and muse in the chimney corner; but
this is not so bad either. I leave for Christiania in a
week and shall arrive a fortnight hence, when I hope to
meet you.</p>

<p>The following congratulatory letter from the
poet Wergeland is characteristic:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="letterhead">
<span class="smcap">The Grotto</span>, <i>22d July</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Ole</span>,&#8212;Welcome <i>Home</i>! I am cursing Denmark,
in which you will sympathize with me. You see
that I date this from a spot unknown to you. It is my
new country&#8211;place, and I look forward to having you of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
an evening on my balcony, which commands the most
glorious view the environs of Christiania can offer. I
want, too, to ask you if I should give you the text of
what I am now writing. I have two delightful subjects,
but both exotic; the one is Persian, the other filled with
raven&#8211;black negroes from the Congo coast and copper&#8211;colored
Portuguese. Or do you wish something Norse?
The latter might be preferable, though the Oriental
subjects are exceedingly charming. I dare suggest
these, since they are not my own. Let me know your
decision.... I have a Norse vaudeville lying by me,
which I can send you, if you will set it to music....</p></div>

<p>Having arranged for the business management
of the theatre during his absence, Ole Bull visited
Hamburg and Copenhagen. He also went to
Prussia, giving concerts in several cities. At the
end of the year he left Bergen for America, sailing
from Liverpool for New York in January, 1852.</p>

<p>Early in March he went to Baltimore to see
his counsel, who had written him of the favorable
termination of his suit with Schubert. He also
visited Lexington, Kentucky, among other places;
and the following note from Henry Clay must
have been written at that time, though it bears
no date:&#8212;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&#8212;I am truly sorry that my bad cold,
which the change of weather and the prospect of rain
induce me to apprehend I might increase by going out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
at night, deprives me of an opportunity of witnessing
your performance from which I anticipated so much
pleasure to&#8211;night. All the other members of my family,
who are not indisposed, have gone to enjoy that satisfaction.</p>

<p>I made an unsuccessful effort to see you to&#8211;day, but

<p>Ole Bull the next morning went to Mr. Clay&#8217;s
house, taking with him his violin. He went into
the room adjoining the one in which Mr. Clay
was seated, and played in a low tone the great
statesman&#8217;s favorite melody, &#8220;The Last Rose of
Summer.&#8221; Mr. Clay&#8217;s interest was immediately
aroused, and he asked if some one was not playing
in the street. As the air continued, he remarked,
&#8220;Ah, that must be Ole Bull; no one but
he could play the old familiar air in that manner.&#8221;
When the artist finished, the doors were
thrown open, and they embraced.</p>

<p>In accordance with this invitation, Ole Bull
gave a concert in Washington on the 26th of
March. He had visited the city to learn more
about the inducements and advantages offered
emigrants to go to the Western States. He had
now a better opportunity than ever of studying
and understanding the government of this country,
because of personal acquaintance with such
men as Webster, Clay, and Sumner. Minister
Sibbern, the resident Swedish ambassador at that
time, was a friend of Ole Bull, and did everything
in his power to make his stay pleasant.</p>

<p>He now performed by invitation in Philadelphia,
Baltimore, and New York. The following
notice of one of his concerts at this time (in the
New York <i>Tribune</i> of May 24, 1852) is from the
pen of Mr. George William Curtis:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Nine years ago Ole Bull, then little known in America,
made his début at the old Park Theatre. Those
who remember the glowing enthusiasm of that evening,
and the triumphal career of which it was the prelude,
will understand the interest with which the news of his
recent arrival among us was received, and the eager curiosity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
to know if he was again to witch our world. On
Saturday evening that curiosity was satisfied by the re&#8211;appearance
of the great violinist, and the revelation of
undiminished power. The audience was in itself a triumph,
on Saturday evening, in the midst of the present
musical excitement attendant upon Madame Goldschmidt&#8217;s
farewell series. To gather three thousand
people in Metropolitan Hall was an evidence of cordial
and admiring remembrance, and of genuine homage to
genius of which any artist might be justly proud. Since
Ole Bull played here before, our musical experience is
enlarged and deepened. Our audience is no longer unused
to fine performance. It has heard much of the
best, and its approbation is more discriminating, and
therefore more flattering. That Ole Bull&#8217;s success on
Saturday evening was very great, it is unnecessary to
say; for no audience (except the French), however critical
and severe, can escape the electrical touch of his
genius. One word, one glance, one sweep, if it is informed
with magnetic power, leaves all rules in the rear,
and asserts its own supremacy. Here is the characteristic
and charm of Ole Bull. Like Paganini, he is an
exceptional person. Like every man of remarkable and
pronounced genius, he is a phenomenon. He is his
own standard; he makes his own rules. It is useless
to pursue him with the traditional rules. His orbit will
not be prescribed or prophesied, for it is eccentric. In
all that he does, the traditional temperament of genius
betrays itself. He is tremulous and tender, but also
rugged and stern, and strong as his native mountains.
He is no unapt type of his Norway, with its sunny but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
breezy heights, with its dark and solemn depths, and,
over all, the clear, blue heaven. In his mien and manner,
in his music and his playing, the same thing is constantly
felt. They are all wonderfully suggestive, but
mainly of bold and melancholy outlines. For the pathos
which inheres in air Northern story and character
permeates all that he does, not as lachrymose sentiment,
but as a genuine minor tone of feeling. It will
not be difficult to infer the impression of his music and
of his performance. It is all subjugated to himself. It
is all means of expression for his own individuality.
He aims not so much at a pure representation of the
subject treated by his music, as at his own peculiarity
of perception in regarding it. The hearer must know
it as it struck him, and in the way he chooses, and all
tends to impress upon that hearer the individuality of
the artist. Hence Ole Bull stands in direct opposition
to the &#8220;classical&#8221; school, of which the peculiarity is to
subdue the artist to the music. He is essentially romantic.
His performance, beyond any we have ever
heard, is picturesque. He uses music as color, and it
matters nothing to him if the treatment be more or less
elaborate, or rhythmical, or detailed, if it succeed in
striking the hearer with the vivid impression sought.
It is unavoidable, therefore, that he is called a charlatan.
It is natural that the classical artists are amazed
at this bold buccaneer roving the great sea of musical
approbation and capturing the costliest prizes of applause.
But these prizes are never permanently held
by weakness. They surrender only to majestic power.
Hence we have the strange spectacle of an immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
and miscellaneous audience hanging enchanted upon
this wondrous bow, through performances of a length
which, in itself, would be enough to wreck most success.
Like the voice of an orator speaking for a people
its hopes, its indignation, its pity and sorrow, so
this violin sings for those who listen their own shifting,
wild, and vague fancies. It is because the artist magnetizes
them, for the time, and they think and dream as
he chooses.</p>

<p>Ole Bull&#8217;s mastery of his violin is imperial. The
proud majesty of his person imparts itself in feeling to
his command of the instrument; and artist, orchestra,
and performance only magnify the man. We can, of
course, have no quarrel with those who do not like it.
If the hearer regrets the want of subtle musical elaboration
in the composition; if he complains of its ponderous
<i>physique</i>; if he is angry at the submission of
the author to the virtuoso, we have nothing to say
but that certainly he has reason, and that, if without
these there were no beauty, no grandeur, no long&#8211;haunting
imagery in the mind, then there would be little
hope for our artist. But every man like Ole Bull
shows that these are not essentials; he shows that the
heart and imagination yield against all wishes and precedents
and rules. Ole Bull is precisely &#8220;an irrefragable
fact,&#8221; against which criticism may dash its head at
leisure. The public heart will follow him and applaud,
because he plays upon its strings as deftly as upon
those of his violin. Possessed of a nature whose moods
sympathize with those of the mass of men, and that in
broad and striking reaches,&#8212;not too finely spun,&#8212;not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
of a Chopin&#8211;like dreaminess, which is rather the
preternatural state of a feeble and excited organization,
but of a broad humanity in his lights and shades, so full
of life and overflowing vigor that he must impart that
sympathy, and will scorn all rules in burning and
branding it upon his audience; it is no marvel that this
eccentric artist sways his hearer as he will, and is as
secure of victory as Napoleon. If we turn more directly
to his performance, we find a purity, a firmness,
a sweetness, and breadth of tone which is unprecedented.
The violin has no secrets from him. It waits
upon him as Ariel upon Prospero. There is no fiddle
left in it. It sings and shouts and weeps as he wills.
It is an orchestra or a flute or an Æolian harp, as the
mood seizes him. The brilliancy, the incredible articulation,
and the rapidity of his execution&#8212;upon one
string or four strings&#8212;with all kinds of marvelous
effects and whims, with the intensity and precision of
his bowing, are in harmony with all the rest. They are
called tricks, but they are only such tricks as the wind
and clouds play; they are only such tricks as an artist
of his organization, who loves the sounds and capacities
of his instrument for their own sake, must necessarily
display. He rejoices in this bewitching of the strings
with a kind of physical delight, and he uses that witchery
so well, with such richness and lavishness, that the
susceptible listener does not long resist. We have left
ourselves no space to follow the performance in detail,
which we shall do upon occasion of the next concert, at
which, in the &#8220;Carnival of Venice,&#8221; his supreme mastery
of the violin will be dazzlingly displayed.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Again Mr. Curtis said:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ole Bull was the Ole Bull of old. His andante and
adagio movements revealed in a remarkable degree
that singular subtlety of his playing by which the instrument
and the means seem lost, and only pure sound
remains. Certain of his strokes are like rays of light.
They seem to flash and glisten sound, rather than produce
it by mechanical means. The wild melancholy
infused through all these pieces and which imparts to
them rather the character of audible reveries than of
formal compositions, is one of the great fascinations of
his performance. It is always the individuality, always
Norway and its weird interpreter, which affects you.
The tenderness, the yearning plaintiveness, the subdued
sweetness of the &#8220;Mother&#8217;s Prayer,&#8221; in particular,
did not fail of a profound impression on the audience.</p></div>

<p>Before starting for the West and South, Ole
Bull concluded the purchase of a large tract of
land for a settlement of Norwegians. This land,
125,000 acres, was on the Susquehanna, in Potter
County, Pennsylvania. On the inauguration of
the colony, he said: &#8220;We are to found a New
Norway, consecrated to liberty, baptized with independence,
and protected by the Union&#8217;s mighty
flag.&#8221;</p>

<p>The representations of his countrymen who
had settled in the South and had told him their
tales of privations and hardships, to which poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
health was added because of the unfavorable climate,
had induced him to make the experiment
of a settlement in the North. Some three hundred
houses were built, with a country inn, a
store, and a church, erected by the founder, and
hundreds flocked to the new colony. He entered
heart and soul into the new project of making
his countrymen happy and prosperous. He also
continued his concerts for means to carry out his
plans, having risked most of his fortune in the
original purchase.</p>

<p>The company of artists with whom Ole Bull
made his Western and Southern tour was a fine
one, including the little Adelina Patti, her sister,
Amalia Patti Strakosch, and Mr. Maurice Strakosch.
They gave many concerts, some two
hundred, we believe, in all.</p>

<p>The following, from a Southern paper, is interesting
for its recognition of the early promise of
the youngest member of the company:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We are to hear Signorina Adelina Patti, a musical
prodigy only eight years old. Unless the musical critics
of the Union are much mistaken, this child is an
extraordinary phenomenon. She sings the great songs
of Malibran, Jenny Lind, Madame Sontag, and Catharine
Hayes with singular power. Her voice is a pure
soprano, and such are its remarkable powers that it is
not necessary to make any allowance for the performance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
being that of a child.... It is a mark of great
musical intrepidity in a child eight years of age to sing
&#8220;<span lang="it">Ah, mon giunge</span>,&#8221; from &#8220;<span lang="it">Sonnambula</span>,&#8221; and Jenny
Lind&#8217;s &#8220;Echo Song&#8221;; and nothing short of the testimony
we have seen could make us believe such a thing
possible. Yet, the whole artistic life of Ole Bull is a
guarantee that nothing but sterling merit can take part
in his concerts. We have no doubt that Signorina
Patti will nestle herself in many a memory to&#8211;night, in
company with Jenny Lind and Catharine Hayes, not
because she is such a singer as they are, but because
her youth will impart to her performance a charm that
their matured powers cannot give.</p></div>

<p>From Georgia the violinist wrote his brother
Edward, February 6, 1853, as follows:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Not indifference, but overwhelming business has prevented
my answering your dear letter,&#8212;and unfortunately
my reply must be as short as possible, although
I have so much on my heart that I long to tell you.
Of my activity as artist and leader, and controller of my
little State in Pennsylvania, you can have a conception
only when you know that I am engaged simultaneously
in laying out five villages, and am contracting with the
Government for the casting of cannon, some ten thousand
in all, for the fortresses, especially for those in
California. Philadelphia has subscribed two millions to
the Sunbury and Erie road, which goes near the colony
on the south; New York has also given two millions
to a branch of the Erie and New York road from
Elmira to Oleana, the northern line of the colony, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
that we shall be only twelve hours distant from New
York, ten from Philadelphia, and about eleven from
Baltimore.</p>

<p>So many have applied for land that I have been
obliged to look out for more in the neighborhood; I
have bought 20,000 acres to the west, and in the adjoining
county (MacKean) I have the refusal of 112,000
acres. In Wyoming County I am contracting for an
old, deserted foundry with forest, water&#8211;power, workshops,
and dwellings, and am taking out patents in
Washington for a new smelting furnace for cannon.</p>

<p>I am giving concerts every day, and must often go
without my dinner, I am so driven. To&#8211;day, Sunday,
I have a moment free; to&#8211;morrow to Columbia, and on
to New Orleans; from there either to Washington, for
the inauguration of President Pierce, or to California
via Nicaragua; and in the latter event I return to New
York to visit the colony the end of April....</p></div>

<p>This letter indicates sufficiently his plans for
the colony, to carry out which successfully would
require the attention and judgment of an energetic
man of business.</p>

<p class="break">About this time he visited California, and in
crossing the Isthmus of Panama his violin case
was given a native to carry, the party riding on
donkeys. They soon lost sight of the man, and
on arriving at Panama it was impossible to find
either him or the case. The rest of the company,
with Mr. Strakosch, were obliged to take the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
steamer, and leave Ole Bull to hunt for his instrument;
but this was not his worst misfortune.
While waiting for the next steamer he fell a victim
to the yellow fever, and, a riot or disturbance
breaking out in the place, he was wholly neglected.
One night, during the worst of his illness,
he was alone, and was obliged to creep off the bed
upon the floor to escape the stray bullets which
crashed through the windows from the affray outside.
When able to get out again, he was miserably
weak, but he left for San Francisco. The advertised
dates for his concerts were all passed,
and the time was unfavorable, because of the lateness
of the season, but he played when his skin
was so tender that it would break and bleed as he
pressed the strings with his fingers. He had many
amusing incidents to tell of the people and life in
the far West. He kept no journal, and many of
his letters written at this time were afterwards
destroyed by fire.</p>

<p>He was now, in his broken state of health, to
make a crushing discovery. He found that the
title to the land in Pennsylvania, bought and
paid for by him in full, was fraudulent, and that
even the improvements he had made were a trespass
on another man&#8217;s property. The forests
were cleared, and 800 settlers had already made
their homes there. Mr. Stewardson, a Quaker,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
and the rightful owner of the land, had for a long
time tried to reach Ole Bull by messenger and letter;
but his efforts had all been futile, so carefully
had Ole Bull&#8217;s business agent watched the
mail, always sent to his care, and guarded him from
approach. When at last the artist, on his return
to Pennsylvania, was legally notified that he was
trespassing, he was dumb&#8211;founded. He mounted
his fine saddle&#8211;horse, and, without rest, rode to
Philadelphia to see his lawyer and agent who had
made the conveyance, hoping that this man&#8217;s good
standing in his profession, the church, and society,
was a guarantee for fair and honest dealing.
The latter tried to quiet his client by telling
him that his papers were good, and insisted that
he should eat something before they talked more
about the matter. Seated at the table, Ole Bull
felt a sudden aversion to the food, although faint
from his long fast and ride, and he refused to eat
or to drink even a cup of tea. At last the man,
when faced by the desperately excited artist, who
insisted upon his going with him to the claimant,
Mr. Stewardson, if the papers were right, suddenly
changed his bearing, and taunted Ole Bull
with his inability to do anything to help himself,
saying: &#8220;I have your money; now, do your
worst!&#8221; The sister of this man met Ole Bull
some years later, and told him that on her brothe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>r&#8217;s
death bed he confessed to her that he had
poisoned the food and cup of tea that he tried to
persuade his client to take, and to which he had
felt so strange an aversion.</p>

<p>Mr. Stewardson was interested in Ole Bull&#8217;s efforts
to found his colony, and offered to make a
sale of the land at a very low price; but the artist
was able only to buy enough land to protect the
people already settled there, and secure the improvements.
He brought a suit against the swindlers,
who now became his malignant and relentless
persecutors. They tried to cripple him in every
way; to prevent his concerts by arrests, and, having
acted as his counsel, they were in possession
of his papers and valuables, which they claimed
for services rendered him, and attached his violin
again and again for debt. While on a trip in
the Western States, he was exposed to malarial
influences along the Mississippi, and the illness
which followed proved the most serious physical
ailment he had ever suffered. He was finally prostrated
by chills and fever, was abandoned by his
manager, and later taken to a farm&#8211;house on a
prairie in Illinois, the hotel&#8211;keeper fearing to keep
him, lest the disease should prove to be small&#8211;pox.
He was so ill that he was delirious. As soon as
he partially recovered his strength, he resumed
his concerts, but the proceeds of these were swallowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
up by the expense of his suit in Pennsylvania,
and by the security he was often forced to
give to release his violin from the attachments
put upon it by his persecutors.</p>

<p>With untiring energy, though his health was
much broken by fever and over&#8211;work, he persevered
with his lawsuits, and succeeded at last in
wresting some thousands of dollars from the man
who had swindled him. Five hard, struggling
years were spent in this way. The help and succor
he received, as often before, seemed Providential.
The best legal talent came to his aid un&#8211;sought,
and in one instance, at least, by a strange
impulse. Reading his newspaper at the breakfast
table one morning, Mr. E. W. Stoughton said to
his wife: &#8220;I see that Ole Bull is in trouble, and
believe I&#8217;ll go into court this morning and find
out about the case.&#8221; He had never met the violinist
personally, but he went, and just at the
right moment to save some valuables and jewels,
which would otherwise have been lost. A lifelong
friendship commenced that day, and Ole
Bull often spent weeks together with the Stoughtons.
In their house he met in the most delightful
way the eminent men of the Bench and Bar. Mr.
Stoughton&#8217;s great and generous service to him,
Ole Bull was ever delighted to mention.</p>

<p>The following letters written at this time will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>

exposed:&#8212;</p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&#8212;Mr. Ole Bull, for whose welfare I feel
a deep interest, leaves this morning for New Haven,
where he intends to give a concert this evening. A
judgment has been obtained against him by a Mr. H.
of this city. Upon this judgment he was arrested on
Saturday and discharged. I fear an attempt may be
made to arrest him again upon the same claim in your
city, and that he may be imprisoned amongst strangers.
This apprehension is based upon the idea that there
is a disposition to persecute him. He has lately been
very ill and is not yet recovered, and I wish to preserve
him from any unpleasant excitement.</p>

<p>The purpose of this, therefore, is to request that,
should Mr. H. institute proceedings against Mr. Bull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
of the character I have suggested, you will procure for
him the necessary bail and act as his counsel; and I
will guarantee you and the bail you may procure
against all liability, and will pay all counsel fees, and,
should the bail prefer it, I will on your requirement
immediately deposit in your hands an amount equal to
their liability.</p>

<p>By doing this you will aid a most estimable and
much injured and unfortunate man, and will confer a
great favor upon</p>

<p class="quotsig">
Yours truly,<br />
<span class="smcap">E. W. Stoughton</span>.</p></div>

<p>All of Ole Bull&#8217;s correspondence shows that
his friends knew how apt he was to neglect his
own affairs, and that they were watchful of his
interests and sympathized with him in his reverses.
To such a nature as his this was everything;
it gave him courage&#8212;it saved him.</p>

<p>When worn out and ill, both from anxiety and
from physical weakness, he received one day a
note from Mrs. Child. She told him that she
had heard of his troubles and his need of rest,
and wanted him to come to her country home at
once. He followed her directions implicitly like
a child, taking the train she had named without
even going first to his hotel. Arrived at the
station he found her and her husband waiting to
drive him to their home. The peace and quiet
of the country, and the presence of these kind
friends, were like heaven to him. Noticing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
probably how tired he was, they took him to his
room, a chamber with a view of trees and fields
beyond, the windows shaded by muslin curtains,
and suggested that he should rest before going
down to tea. With one look at the quiet landscape
outside he threw himself on the bed. On
waking he found Mrs. Child watching by his
side, and started up with an apology for having
kept her, as he feared, waiting too long. She
smiled and told him that it was almost twenty&#8211;four
hours since he had lain down for a few
moments&#8217; rest. The anxiety of his friends was
relieved when he woke refreshed, and, as he said,
his reason saved.</p>

<p>The following letter will also show the help
and encouragement his friends gave him at this
hard period of his life:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="letterhead">
<span class="smcap">Andover</span>, Monday, <i>October 8</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Friend</span>,&#8212;We are all sitting around our centre
table; the blaze of the fire flickering on the walls,
and enlivening the hearth. We are recalling the
pleasant hours spent in Hartford. My husband says
to me&#8212;Did you indeed see Ole Bull? He has always
been one of my ideals&#8212;how I wish he would come
here! Why, says I, he did promise to come, perhaps:&#8212;so
you see that you are not forgotten. Do not, my
dear friend, despair of human nature&#8212;nor wholly despair
of America; the experience of the past has
shivered so many brilliant illusions. You remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
that hope remains even at the bottom of Pandora&#8217;s
box.</p>

<p>Meanwhile let me send you my husband&#8217;s assurance
with mine that a fireside welcome is ever kept for you
at the old stone cabin in Andover. It is not &#8220;the elephant,&#8221;
interesting as he is, but the elephant&#8217;s master,
that shall be made welcome&#8212;welcome for the music
within, whether he choose or not to give it outward expression.</p>

<p>Come speak to us of the lovely fjords and dripping
waterfalls and glittering lakes of Norway&#8212;and, if you
come soon enough, we will take you to see our beautiful
lakes in Andover.</p>

<p>But if you cannot come, let our invitation remain
by you as a token of a place where you might rest for
a while in kind and simple friendly welcome,&#8212;where
you may at any time, if you choose, come and sleep a
day without our troubling you with a word; in short,
where you shall find rest and do exactly as you please.
Nobody shall ask you to play a tune; nobody shall hinder
your playing an opera; you shall come and go at
will and be as free as in the wood. Liberty is about all
that we keep here and that we offer.</p>

<p>I trust that your affairs in New York are not going
ill; but however they go, let me hope that you will be
borne above this world. God is light, and in Him is no
darkness at all. When we perish with hunger there is
always bread enough to spare in our Father&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>
With kindliest feelings and remembrances,</p>

<p>James Gordon Bennett had been most kind to
Ole Bull from the time of his first visit to the
United States. When at that time the friends of
Vieuxtemps were assailing him by personal attacks
as well as musical criticism, Mr. Bennett
called, and offered the columns of the <i>Herald</i> for
any answer Ole Bull might like to make. With
a warm pressure of the hand, he replied in his
broken English: &#8220;I tink, Mr. Benneett, it is best
tey writes against me and I plays against tem.&#8221;
&#8220;You&#8217;re right, Ole Bull, quite right,&#8221; said the
editor with a laugh; &#8220;but remember the <i>Herald</i>
is always open to you.&#8221; The following characteristic
quotation is from one of Mr. Bennett&#8217;s
notes: &#8220;I am happy you are again so successful.
You, and you only, can raise the devil or
the angels.&#8221;</p>

<p>A volume of Theodore Parker&#8217;s sermons, with
an affectionate word of presentation, is among the
mementos of his Boston visits.</p>

<p>The press of the country, as well as friends,
gave him warm expressions of confidence and
sympathy. A Philadelphia paper said, among
other things, of a two hours&#8217; interview with Ole
Bull:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He speaks of his wrongs with the most forbearing
disposition, and shrinks from thrusting them before the
public and making himself an object of sympathy. He
has always firmly refused to do so, believing that justice
in his case will ultimately triumph without any adventitious
aid from a sympathizing public.</p></div>

<p>The <i>Evening Post</i>, of New York, for March
9, 1857, said:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Norwegian made his appearance last evening at
Dodsworth Hall, and once more exercised his spell of
musical witchery over a crowded audience. His well&#8211;known
identity with his violin, playing on it as if the
strings of his heart were strained over it, seems to be as
perfect as ever, while the new story that his heart has
to tell&#8212;the troubles and reverses he has undergone
since he last played among us&#8212;seems to be faithfully
added to its expression. He played with more intensity
of concentration in the passages of force and vivid rapidity,
while his lingerings upon the sadder and more pathetic
strains were indescribably truthful in their mournfulness.
It is the peculiarity of Ole Bull, and perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the secret of his charm over the sympathies of his audience,
that all he plays seems so faithfully autobiographic.
His expressive face tells the same story as his violin.
The listeners to his music last night were evidently completely
absorbed in the study of the <i>man</i>; and it is a
strong warranty for the renewal of his success that he
can now exercise, even better than before, his wonderful
personal magnetism. His history and present position,
we may as well add, fully entitle him to the sympathy
for which his violin pleads so expressively.</p></div>

<p>In 1856, the violinist&#8217;s eldest son had joined
him, and had been most kindly received by his
father&#8217;s friends. Many notes, still preserved, attest
the thoughtful attentions given them when ill and
confined to their beds, as they both were in New
York that season.</p>

<p>When Ole Bull gave his last concerts in Dodsworth
Hall, in New York, in 1857, he was so ill
that he had to be helped on and off the stage, and
occasionally the applause of the audience alone
kept him roused to consciousness, so weak was he
from the chills and fever. No suffering ever kept
him from appearing when announced, if he could
possibly do it; and in his long experience he used
to say with pride that he had, almost without fail,
kept all his engagements with the public. He now
decided that he must try what his native air would
do for him, and in the autumn he returned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
Bergen. He found that unfavorable reports had
preceded him, and where he ought only to have
met with sympathy at home, he sometimes found
suspicion. It was said that he had speculated
ruthlessly at the expense of his countrymen, and
that they were the only sufferers by his misfortunes.
American institutions and tendencies were
not at all popular among a large class in Norway
at that day, and Republican liberty, it was said,
meant only license. Poor in health and purse, Ole
Bull&#8217;s home&#8211;coming was not to be envied. Mother
Nature was the same, however, and he soon gained
strength and courage from his native mountain
air. He resumed his direction of the theatre,
having engaged Björnstjerne Björnson as dramatic
instructor, which gave the enterprise a strong and
fresh impulse. Björnson had recently published
&#8220;Synnöve Solbakken&#8221; and &#8220;Arne,&#8221; which latter
he dedicated to Ole Bull.</p>

<p>A. O. Winje wrote him:&#8212;</p>

<p class="letterhead">
<span class="smcap">Christiania</span>, <i>20th February, 1860</i>.

<p>You cannot imagine, dear Ole Bull, how happy I am
at your success, and that in this great work you, like
the gods, are ever young.... Eight days since, when
the first good news came in prose and verse (I take the
Bergen papers), I had to run down to your brother Randulf,
to tell him.</p></div>

<p>After a mention of the assembling of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
Swedish Parliament and the outlook of the Norse
interests in that stirring period, when the question
of the governorship of Norway by a Swede
or Norwegian was being considered, and telling
Ole Bull that it would be a good time for him
to make his influence felt in Sweden by a visit
there, he concluded:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Now when all with you is as you wish it, come this
way and give vent to your wrath, for it is not well that
you should have too much good fortune&#8212;not even you.
The gods themselves could not bear it; the Roman
Triumvirs, remember, had their buffoons in their triumphal
cars. Do you go to Russia or England? Wherever
you go, God bless you! Greet Björnson.</p>

<p>Ole Bull met Fanny Elssler in Vienna, in 1877.
She recalled with interest many of the incidents
of her visit to the United States, which she said
seemed then like a dream to her. Still handsome,
the noble graceful carriage as striking as ever,
her face with its winning smile was one to attract
a stranger&#8217;s eye in the crowded audience room of
the great Musik Verein Hall.</p>

<p>From Hamburg Ole Bull went to Vienna and
Pesth, and his success, as reported by the papers,
was extraordinary. He wrote to his son, from
Vienna, May 8, 1858:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Thanks for your dear letter, which I would have answered
at once if important changes in my plans had
not made it necessary to defer my return to Bergen. I
received offers from the directors in Pesth and Gratz,
and after the conditions and dates were fixed I was
asked to make later dates. I leave for Pesth this evening.
Day after to&#8211;morrow the first concert, and the
fourth on the 17th! Therefore I cannot be in Bergen.
I hope, though, to reach there the end of this month.</p>

<p>You know what stress I lay on the observance of
this Thanksgiving&#8211;festival, and if pecuniary obligations
did not compel me otherwise, I would instantly go to
you; but <i lang="la">ratio pro voluntate</i>!</p>

<p>In Berlin I met my old friend Bettina von Arnim,
who, sad to say, is fast approaching the end. She was
so glad to see me that I delayed my departure two days,
to celebrate her birthday with my violin. The next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
day Joachim came from Hanover, to make my acquaintance:
I of course staid one day more on his account.
I see that he is now playing in London. Ernst is very
ill in Baden&#8211;Baden; he, poor man, is crippled by gout!...
I have also seen Liszt after an interval of sixteen
years: he has taken holy orders....</p></div>

<p>He writes on the 27th of May from Pesth,
which he now revisited after the lapse of nineteen
years:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I leave in an hour for Vienna. I have taken a
course of bitter salt waters at Ofen; my blood is benefitted.
It was necessary, as the fever had come again,
and although not so serious as in the United States,
still to a degree that caused me much inconvenience.
I shall now hurry home.</p>

<p>The enthusiasm has been so great here, that I have
been obliged to promise to return at the end of the
year....</p></div>

<p>He did not return directly, however, as it was
deemed advisable for him to go to Carlsbad,
where he spent the summer. Among the friends
he especially enjoyed meeting there were Mr. and
Mrs. Henry A. Wise, of Virginia, whom he had
known intimately in the United States.</p>

<p>In October he was again in Norway, and on
his return to Bergen he bought of his mother the
ancestral home, Valestrand. He spent that winter
in improving the place; he commenced the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
thorough drainage of the land, which work he
pushed vigorously for years, and it was not interrupted
by the winters, so mild is the climate on
that coast. The estate now belongs to his son,
Mr. Alexander Bull. The following picturesque
description of the place is from an article by H.
H. in the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> for June, 1881:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Another memorable Bergen day was a day at Valestrand,
on the island Osteröen. Valestrand is a farm
which has been in the possession of Ole Bull&#8217;s family
for several generations, and is still in the possession of
Ole Bull&#8217;s eldest son. It lies two hours&#8217; sail north
from Bergen,&#8212;two hours, or four, according to the
number of lighters loaded with cotton bales, wood, etc.,
which the steamer picks up to draw. Steamers on
Norway fjords are like country gentlemen who go into
the city every day and come out at night, always doing
unexpected errands for people along the road. No
steamer captain going out from Bergen may say how
many times he will stop on his journey, or at what hour
he will reach its end: all of which is clear profit for the
steamboat company, no doubt, but is worrying to travelers;
especially to those who leave Bergen of a morning
at seven, as we did, invited to breakfast at Valestrand
at nine, and do not see Osteröen&#8217;s shore till near
eleven. People who were not going to Valestrand to
breakfast that day were eating breakfast on board, all
around us: poor people eating cracknels and dry bread
out of baskets; well&#8211;to&#8211;do people eating sausage, eggs,
and coffee, neatly served at little tables on deck, and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
prepared in a tiny coop below&#8211;stairs, hardly big enough
for one person to turn around in. It is an enticing
sight always for hungry people to see eating going on;
up to a certain point it whets appetite, but beyond that
it is both insult and injury.</p>

<p>The harbor of Valestrand is a tiny amphitheatre of
shallow water. No big craft can get to the shore. As
the steamer comes to a stop opposite it, the old home of
Ole Bull is seen on a slope at the head of the harbor,
looking brightly out over a bower of foliage to the
southern sun. It appears to be close to the water, but,
on landing, one discovers that he is still a half hour&#8217;s
walk away from it. A little pathway of mossy stones,
past an old boat&#8211;house, on whose thatched roof flowering
grasses and a young birch&#8211;tree were waving, leads
up from the water to the one road on the island. Wild
pansies, white clover and dandelions, tinkling water
among ferns and mosses along the roadsides, made the
way beautiful; low hills rose on either side, softly
wooded with firs and birches feathery as plumes; in the
meadows peasant men and women making hay,&#8212;the
women in red jackets and white blouses, a delight to
the eye. Just in front of the house is a small, darkly
shaded lake, in which there is a mysterious floating
island, which moves up and down at pleasure changing
its moorings often.</p>

<p>The house is wooden, and painted of a pale flesh
color. The architecture is of the light and fantastic
order of which so much is to be seen in Norway,&#8212;the
instinctive reaction of the Norwegian against the sharp,
angular, severe lines of his rock&#8211;made, rock&#8211;bound country,&#8212;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
it is vindicated by the fact that fantastic carvings,
which would look trivial and impertinent on houses
in countries where Nature herself had done more decorating,
seem here pleasing and in place. Before the
house were clumps of rose&#8211;bushes in blossom, and great
circles of blazing yellow eschscholtzias. In honor of
our arrival, every room had been decorated with flowers
and ferns; and clumps of wild pansies in bloom had
been set along the steps to the porch. Ole Bull&#8217;s own
chamber and music&#8211;room are superb rooms, finished in
yellow pine, with rows of twisted and carved pillars, and
carved cornices and beams and panels, all done by Norwegian
workmen.</p>

<p>Valestrand was his home for many years, abandoned
only when he found one still more beautiful on the
island of Lysöen, sixteen miles southwest of Bergen.</p>

<p>A Norwegian supper of trout freshly caught, and
smothered in cream, croquettes, salad, strawberries,
goat&#8217;s&#8211;milk cheese, with fine&#8211;flavored gooseberry wine,
served by a Norwegian maid in a white&#8211;winged head&#8211;dress,
scarlet jacket, and stomacher of gay beads, closed
our day. As we walked back to the little moss&#8211;grown
wharf, we found two peasants taking trout from the
brook. Just where it dashed foaming under a little
foot&#8211;bridge, a stake&#8211;lined box trap had been plunged
deep in the water. As we were passing, the men lifted
it out, dripping, ten superb trout dashing about wildly
in it, in terror and pain; the scarlet spots on their sides
shone like garnet crystals in the sun, as the men emptied
them on the ground, and killed them, one by one,
by knocking their heads against a stone with a sharp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
quick stroke, which could not have been so cruel as it
looked.</p>

<p>On our way back to Bergen we passed several little
row&#8211;boats, creeping slowly along, loaded high with
juniper boughs. They looked like little green islands
broken loose from their places, and drifting out to sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;For somebody&#8217;s sorrow!&#8221; we said thoughtfully, as
we watched them slowly fading from sight in the distance....</p></div>

<p>In the winter of 1860 Ole Bull went to Stockholm,
giving seventeen concerts in that city, and
then to Finland.</p>

<p>In 1861&#8211;1862 he gave forty&#8211;six concerts in
England, Scotland, and Ireland. He left the settlement
of his accounts with the impressario till
the end of the trip, and then giving up the memorandum
before the money was handed him, received
not one penny of the proceeds, all of which
remained in the pockets of the manager.</p>

<p>While he was in Paris, in 1862, the sad intelligence
of his wife&#8217;s death reached him. She had
suffered much the last years of her life from ill&#8211;health,
and, living in an adopted country, the misfortunes
and sorrows of her husband, added to
her own, were more than she could bear.</p>

<p>The following letter to his son was written
from Hamburg, September 18, 1862:&#8212;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>Instead of coming myself with the steamer to Bergen,
as I had hoped, I am obliged to wait for&#8212;my
trunk, which went astray between Cologne and this
place, and for which I have waited now three whole
days. Notwithstanding my troubles, my health was
better, and would have kept improving had I not broken
a rib in my left side, just as I was about to leave
Godesberg, after giving a concert for the benefit of the
organ in the Catholic church there, by request of the
authorities. The concert was a brilliant affair, but I
had to pay for it. It seemed that it had been planned
to convert me to Catholicism, and a young Jesuit, who
was taking the water&#8211;cure, sought, partly by charges
against Protestantism, partly by flattery or threats, to
make himself interesting; and when I declined his entertainment
he turned about suddenly and claimed to
be greatly interested in my views. One morning he
came to meet me just as I had returned from a walk
in the mountains and was going to breakfast, handing
me a newspaper. As I accepted it and bowed, he threw
his arms about my neck and pressed his knee against
my breast; I felt and heard a crack in my side, as I
pushed him from me. I went to the hotel, but did not
feel well, and the doctor found a rib was broken. I had
to keep my bed day and night for a week&#8217;s time, using
wet bandages to prevent inflammation. When I got
out, I exerted myself too much, so the bone has not
knit together as well as could be desired.</p>

<p>I went recently to Aix&#8211;la&#8211;Chapelle to get my Guarnerius,
which I had confided to a Frenchman, Monsieur
D., to repair; but on my arrival I found all the parts
were separated; the side&#8211;pieces by themselves, the top<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
and back also; the neck divided, and the man himself
in despair! I was obliged to put it together again myself,
but what a task! He helped me. Poor fellow, I
was sorry for him. When he saw what wretched work
he had made of it, I could neither take the violin from
him, and thereby ruin his reputation, nor scold him
more. At last it was finished, and now I have three
Guarneriuses beside my pearl, the Nicholas Amati, large
pattern, that has the most beautiful tone of them all.
I exchanged another for it in London last year, and Mr.
Plowden, an amateur, offered me a considerable advance;
but I would rather part with all my other violins
than this, which is remarkable for its peculiar softness
and clearness. Besides, it fits the hand well, and has
the greatest variety of tone&#8211;color, that is to say, versatility
of expression. I have had and am having a hard
time. I must try to keep up courage. If I am to go
under, I will still fight as long as I can,&#8212;perhaps the
sun will shine when I least expect it!...</p></div>

<p>In 1863 he visited Christiania, and hoped to induce
the people there to establish an Academy of
Music. It was but a continuation of his earlier
programme and thought of &#8220;a Norse Orchestra
in a Norse Theatre.&#8221; He explained himself in an
article published in the <i>Illustrated News</i>:&#8212;</p>

<p class="center">A NORSE MUSIC ACADEMY.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I saw the new flag hoisted above our nation: that
flag which adorns the harbors of the world, and which,
at half&#8211;mast, has mourned many of the men who, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
face of opposition, labored to raise it. In this flag, floating
above us, and the Constitution under us, the Norse
house has its roof and floor. The house can now be
seen, and has a name among the nations. But this does
not complete it, and it would be a sin to leave it half
finished, exposed to wind and weather. There are still
many rooms to be furnished, if the house is to be occupied
by a nation claiming civilization and culture. Between
the Danish and the Norse drama there is now
drawn a tolerably definite line; but round about on the
home walls hang the pictures of all nations, brought by
wanderers from every corner of the globe&#8212;as might
be expected in a sailor&#8217;s home, which ours is. There is
so much that is foreign and so little of our own! Even
our home subjects are worked up in foreign lands, by
our own homesick artists, it is true, but bearing on
them the servile mark of exile, set there by a borrowed,
foreign brush. I have spent many a sad hour with
these men,&#8212;exiled not so much because of our national
poverty as of our national lack of culture,&#8212;wanderers,
to be met with the world over. We have talked of the
dream cherished in common by all Norse artists: the
coming home and uniting all the forces in schools in
which the national art could be developed to an independent
manhood, and Norway be given the honor
which foreigners now take from her. When these longings
become too intense for control, the exiles fly haphazard
home&#8212;painters, sculptors, and musicians striking
against the old, gray, naked cliffs of their country&#8217;s
insensibility. Forgetting old and futile efforts in the
new, one now and then manages to gain a slight foot&#8211;hold;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
but the rest must abroad again, to repeat the
old story. This, the history of our country&#8217;s attitude
towards art is a disgrace to the nation, and a crime
against those men who have given their all to art, and
are driven to sell our honor abroad.</p>

<p>My calling in this world is the Norse music. I am no
painter, no sculptor, no writer. I am a musician, and,
being one, I ought to be trusted when I say that I hear
a wonderfully deep and characteristic sound&#8211;board vibrating
in the breasts of my people. The desire of my
life has been to give it strings; that it may find voice, and
its deep tones penetrate the temple as Norway&#8217;s church
music bears the words of the minister to the hearts of
the congregation; that on the battle&#8211;field it may remind
the country&#8217;s defenders of their hearth&#8211;stones; that it
may be heard from our orchestras and from a National
art which can rise only from this source; that it may
sound from the pianos round the land, cultivating, ennobling
the family&#8211;life more than all the languages of
the world, in charm and intelligibility unsurpassed! I
have spent my life in striving to climb these gray cliffs
with the other Norse artists, by trying to overcome the
denationalized musical taste. Now, I propose to my colleagues,
the musicians, that we each lend a hand in a
united effort to scale the rocks and reach the height;
that we found an Academy for musical instruction. It
may be that we shall at last plant the flag on the heights,
and be able to reach a helping hand down to others who
are toiling upward!</p>

<p>To his son he wrote from Christiania, February
27, 1863:&#8212;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To&#8211;day I spoke with the King; he has signed the
petition for an Academy, asking for an appropriation of
$1200 a year from the Exchequer. Subscriptions are
now being privately arranged. We have the offer of the
free use of the dramatic company&#8217;s rooms,&#8212;in accordance
with the will of the donor (Collet), who gave them
for the benefit and advancement of the dramatic and
musical arts, and also to be a preparatory school for the
Norse stage.</p>

<p>I have much to do, and meet, as always, a great deal
of opposition; but I do not doubt that it will go. One
must strike with all one&#8217;s force. Poor Thorvald!<a name="Anchor-19" id="Anchor-19"></a><a href="#Footnote-19" class="Anchor" title="Go to footnote 19.">[19]</a> I
try to quiet myself with the thought that I did everything
in my power to prevent his going to sea, but he
would make his own way for himself....</p></div>

<p>Jonas Lie says:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Academy, as we know, was not founded; but the
seed&#8212;the thought&#8212;was at that time planted. Since
then it has grown and matured, and to&#8211;day we have a
body of artists and composers, and quite another musical
culture ready to receive it.</p></div>

<p>From 1863 to 1867 Ole Bull gave concerts in
Germany, Poland, and Russia. He was honored
in Berlin and Copenhagen by special festivities.
In Copenhagen, at a banquet given by the &#8220;Norse
Union,&#8221; the eminent Danish poet, Carl Ploug,
proposed the toast to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>&#8220;the king of the realm of
art.&#8221; He traveled in Russia during the seasons
of 1866&#8211;1867. He used to say that no professional
trip ever gave him more pleasure, and he
would not venture to repeat it. He wrote a musical
friend in Christiania, from Königsberg, June
4, 1866, as follows:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It was strange that the notice of my death should
have been dated the 10th of April, the very day that a
silver music&#8211;rest was presented to me by the students
of Moscow. I had given a concert for them, on which
occasion we had made a great demonstration, because of
the attempted assassination. How fortunate that it all
turned out so well! The students had asked me to lead
them, and I began by calling on the people (the first
time it had been done!) to sing the royal hymn....</p>

<p>I have sent two Arabian horses from St. Petersburg:
one black, by name Godolfin; the other Caraguese, a
golden bronze with black mane and tail. They are of
different breed, the black being south&#8211;Arabian blood, and
the other Persian&#8211;Arabian. You will also see a beautiful
violoncello<a name="Anchor-20" id="Anchor-20"></a><a href="#Footnote-20" class="Anchor" title="Go to footnote 20.">[20]</a> which will make your mouth water, as well
as a glorious Antonius and Hieronimus Amati; I have
also bought a Joseph Guarnerius in Moscow....</p></div>

<p>From Wiesbaden, July 2, 1865, he wrote his
son:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I am to leave Hamburg by the Saturday steamer for
Bergen. This coming Wednesday I am to give a concert
in the Theatre, for the benefit of the actors&#8217; fund,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
and leave Thursday, going direct to Hamburg. I long
to see you again, and to pass two months in quiet at
Valestrand. I am much benefited by the baths, and it
was well that I could give the time, as the same old
symptoms of chills and fever had returned. I am now
almost well, and hope, with the friendly action of the
fine Valestrand air, to be entirely quit of this oppressive
burden. I have in hand a work on the violin, which I
hope to finish during my summer rest&#8212;and to go out
again in the autumn with new vigor. I trust you will
think that I look better.
I passed some days with the Duke of Nassau, at his
palace in Weilburg, and he courteously gave me the
Adolf cross; he claims a special value for it, since it
was never before given to an artist.</p>

<p>But think, Alexander! I have been so foolish as to
buy a delightful Gaspar da Salo,<a name="Anchor-21" id="Anchor-21"></a><a href="#Footnote-21" class="Anchor" title="Go to footnote 21.">[21]</a> which is now my favorite.
It has a much more majestic and noble tone than
my other violins, and is adapted for concert purposes.</p></div>

<p>After invitations and messages to friends and
relatives to visit the new house which he had built,
but had not yet seen, he continues:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I sent 2000 willows from Amsterdam. You have
planted them by the stream, the best place for them?
Have you bridged the brook and filled the slope, and
remembered the poor birch&#8211;trees, which must have lived
only on hope and air? You have papered some of the
walls; we can pother and putter about these for a
change, can we not? Serious conferences shall be held,
and furnish us amusement....</p></div>

<p>P. S.&#8212;We should make some excursions to the interior
of the island this summer, with the fiddle on our
back.</p></div>

<p>This extract from a letter to his son, in Paris,
dated at Bergen, September 4, 1866, is interesting
for its prescience of political events:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Take care, Alexander! political events are following
closely on one another; the French have an enemy in
the United States not to be ignored [since the affair in
Mexico]; they must also beware of Germany; their
fleets and finance would soon be ruined by a war. The
times have changed, and the turn has come for Prussia
to play the master in Europe. She has a solid basis, a
sound exchequer; while in France all is unsettled and
can easily fall out of equilibrium. The French are to be
banished from Rome, too; and they must create new
surprises and new <i lang="fr">gloires</i> in time, or fail. The great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
man [Napoleon III.] is seriously ill; France knows it,
and is silent; but events will speak. Be careful,&#8212;never
take part in political discussions, I pray you!</p></div>

<p>Ole Bull was an eager reader of the newspapers,
and kept up always with the daily telegraphic
news. In the war between Germany and
France he was an enthusiastic advocate of the
German cause as against the imperialism of Napoleon.
A fortnight before the event, he predicted
to a friend in Wisconsin the compulsory
resignation of McMahon as president of the republic
and the election of Grévy, and, with almost
faultless accuracy, the members of Grévy&#8217;s
cabinet. He had a personal acquaintance with
leading men and workers in every country of Europe,
and this, together with his profound sympathy
with the thoughts and aspirations of the people
as a whole, enabled him to arrive at his own
conclusions.</p>

<p>From St. Petersburg he wrote his son, April
17, 1867:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These lines to tell you in haste that I have determined
to visit Paris as soon as possible. To&#8211;morrow to
Warsaw, where I am to give two concerts, and then
direct to Paris....</p>

<p>I have just composed a fantasy on a Russian air,
&#8220;The Nightingale,&#8221;&#8212;my adieu to Moscow,&#8212;and was
obliged to repeat it. It has no great musical worth,&#8212;only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
effective. Perhaps you will like it; there is a sad
thought running through it. I will rewrite it at Valestrand.
My &#8220;Gaspar da Salo&#8221; is full of joy, and bears
its virtuoso like an Arab; it is really matchless since I
had a bar of seven&#8211;hundred&#8211;years&#8217;&#8211;old wood put in by
Weihe; and I have discovered a new method for measuring
and placing the bar in its relation to the building
and playing of the violin.</p>

<p>Greet our countrymen in Paris most cordially....</p></div>

<p>In November, 1867, Ole Bull again visited the
United States. He went directly to the West,
giving his first concert in Chicago. In the
Northwestern States were some 300,000 of his
own countrymen, and they received him everywhere
with rejoicing. In many towns they met
him with torchlight processions and speeches of
welcome, and he often left substantial proofs of
his sympathy in gifts to their churches and libraries.</p>

<p>One evening in Milwaukee he played Paganini&#8217;s
&#8220;Second Concerto&#8221; with so much spirit
that his audience caught the enthusiasm of the
player. On leaving the stage he whispered to
his son: &#8220;I believe Paganini himself would have
been pleased to&#8211;night, had he heard me.&#8221;</p>

<p>A Philadelphia writer, speaking of this visit of
Ole Bull, says:&#8212;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>It is probable that the artist was never in his life so
acceptable to the American people as during his concert
tour of 1868&#8211;1869. But no kindliness of fortune
could prevent the constantly recurring incidents and
accidents of this extremely interesting life. In the autumn
of 1868 Ole Bull was a passenger down the Ohio
River, when a collision between two steamboats occasioned
a terrible accident, which involved the loss of
many lives. &#8220;On that evening,&#8221; as he narrated afterwards,
&#8220;without having any reason for what I did, I put
on my coat and overcoat and went up on deck with my
violin&#8211;case in hand. It was then past midnight.&#8221; Soon
afterward the shock occurred. One boat had a quantity
of petroleum, which, igniting, poured out upon the
river and surrounded both vessels with a circle of fire.
He was obliged to spring overboard, but reached the
shore with violin and person alike intact, and after a
tough struggle up the precipitous and clayey bank of
the stream found a firm footing at the top. He was
obliged to walk till daylight before he found a shelter.</p></div>

<p>There was enough music, fortunately, in the
violin&#8211;case for immediate use; and although the
company had lost all their luggage, only one concert
was given up. The second night after the
accident Ole Bull performed in Cincinnati as announced,
but was obliged to appear in his traveling
dress.</p>

<p class="break">In the summer of 1869 he gave his services to
the great Peace Jubilee in Boston, conducted by
Mr. P. S. Gilmore, and this so delayed his departure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
for Europe that he could make only a
flying visit to Norway. He returned again in
the autumn. The winter following, he gave concerts
and traveled constantly. He was everywhere
warmly received by the public, both East
and West.</p>

<p>In April, 1870, he sailed for Norway. The
New York <i>Tribune</i> made the following mention
of his departure:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Herr Ole Bull, from the N. Y. Philharmonic Society,&#8221;
was the inscription upon a beautiful silken flag
presented to the great violinist, yesterday, on the deck
of the United States revenue cutter, which conveyed
him from the barge&#8211;office at the Battery to the steamship
Russia. The flag was the Norwegian colors, with
the Star&#8211;Spangled Banner inserted in the upper staff
section. The committee of presentation were Messrs.
Hill, Schaad, and Doremus, the latter being the spokesman.
Ole Bull was accompanied on board the steamer
by quite a large number of friends, among whom were
Miss Adelaide Phillips, Miss Alide Topp, Mrs. Belknap
and sister, Dr. and Mrs. Doremus, General Banks, Senator
Conkling, Mr. F. S. Appleton, and others. Dr.
Doremus&#8217;s presentation speech, happily conceived, was
responded to in the warm&#8211;hearted and impulsive manner
peculiar to the artist, whose impulsiveness has ever
characterized the products of his genius, and whose
warm&#8211;heartedness is known to hundreds who have
blessed him for his generosity. Senator Conkling and
General Banks also made appropriate speeches. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
the cutter left the steamer, the company waved together
their regrets and their farewells; and the form of
the fine old gentleman, bare&#8211;headed and swinging his
hat, was seen as long as forms could be distinguished
in the distance.</p></div>

<p>This beautiful flag was, according to Ole Bull&#8217;s
promise on its acceptance, always carried in the
17th of May processions in Bergen, and floated
on the 4th of July.</p>

<p>A beautiful silver vase presented by the N. Y.
Philharmonic Society that season, a piece of silver
plate given by the Young Men&#8217;s Christian
Association of New York city, for whom he had
played, and a very rich and beautiful gold crown
given him in San Francisco, were among the
mementos which he carried home to Norway.</p>

<p>A still closer tie was soon to bind him to the
United States, the country which seemed already
his by adoption. In Madison, Wis., in the winter
of 1868, Ole Bull first made the acquaintance
which resulted in his second marriage. He took
a kindly interest in the musical studies of his
friend there, and later in New York. To others
this delightful relation of teacher, adviser, and
friend seemed the only one permissible; but he
wrote: <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>&#8220;Other than human powers have decided
my fate.... The sunbeams I shut out, but the
sun itself I could not annihilate.&#8221;</p>

<p>The marriage was delayed in deference to the
wishes of others for some months, but without
resulting in a modification of their fears concerning
the disparity of years and other conditions.
It was later decided to have a private marriage.
This was consummated in Norway, and publicly
announced and confirmed on the return to the
United States, three months later, in the autumn
of 1870.</p>

<p>During the years 1867&#8211;69 Ole Bull had worked
on his improvement of the piano&#8211;forte. This attempt
to build a piano outside a manufactory
would have been a very doubtful experiment even
if the principle of construction had not been itself
an experiment. He would not permit the
use of any of the old means for strengthening
and sustaining the sounding&#8211;board, which necessarily
in time destroy its power of giving out a
good quality of tone. His principal effort was to
sustain the board at the ends, leaving the sides
free, not permitting the board to be pierced for
the insertion of screws to unite the upper and
lower frame&#8211;work, as is generally done. The
wooden strips employed to strengthen the great
surface of the board should, he thought, be made
to help the tone as well, on the principle of the
bar in the violin; the whole to be so adjusted that
the wood might grow better with use and age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>The first instrument was made under very
great disadvantages. The workmen had it in
hand while Ole Bull was absent on his concert
tour. A telegram would announce to him the
breaking of the frame, which he would try to
remedy by suggestions sent by telegram or letter.
This instrument cost some $15,000. Not satisfied
with this, he commenced another, and met
the same old difficulties in the frame, or new ones
quite as serious. John Ericsson learned of his
trouble, had him explain his idea, made a frame
of the right weight and strength, only insisting
upon one condition,&#8212;the acceptance of it by
Ole Bull as a present. This second piano proved
satisfactorily that the theory was sound and practicable.
Ole Bull had hoped to perfect his invention
and introduce the instruments to the public.
This would have given him the greatest satisfaction;
for even the best pianos give only for a short
time a musical quality of tone, and necessarily deteriorate
from use, not only because of the wear
in the action, which can be replaced, but also on
account of the destruction and breaking down of
the woody cells and tissues of the sounding&#8211;board
itself, under the improperly distributed strain
brought to bear upon it.</p>

<p>The opportunity never came to Ole Bull of
doing more than to satisfy himself that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
theory could be realized. Two pianos only were
made; but these proved the possibility of doing
away with the objectionable features in the present
construction of the instrument, which, in
time, must destroy the vitality of the sounding&#8211;board
and its power to produce a pure tone. It
is well known that none but new pianos are used
by professional players; and an instrument which
has been used for any length of time positively
vitiates a musical ear.</p>

<p>No friendly service ever touched Ole Bull
more deeply than the generous helpfulness of
John Ericsson, whom he admired and loved. It
is with a sense of grateful recognition that the
following letter is now given in concluding this
mention of the piano:&#8212;</p>

dear to me, I omitted to refer to his admirable conception
of securing the strings of pianos to a separate
frame, composed of metal, so formed that it may be applied
to any wooden stand more or less ornamented.
It was my privilege, often, to listen to my lamented
friend&#8217;s disquisitions relating to the violin, showing his
clear mechanical conceptions of the laws which govern
the construction of that most perfect of all musical instruments.
The great violinist possessed a singularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
accurate knowledge of the necessary relations between
the capability of resisting the tension of the strings,
and the elasticity requisite to admit of a perfectly free
movement of the sounding&#8211;board, and other parts of
the delicate structure, indispensable to produce infinitely
minute vibrations, the control of which by his
master hand created tones which enabled him to charm
his hearers as none of his rivals could.</p>

<p>I regard the independent metallic frame for holding
the strings of pianos as an invention which would do
honor to any professional mechanician; and I contemplate
with much satisfaction the circumstance that my
departed friend intrusted to me the construction of the
first specimen of his important improvement.</p>

<p>
I am, my dear Mrs. Bull,</p>
<p class="sig">Yours very sincerely,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">J. Ericsson</span>.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Ericsson had previously written of Ole
Bull: &#8220;So warm a heart and so generous a disposition
as his I have never known.&#8221; These
words, it may be truthfully said, express the
sentiment and the judgment of the violinist concerning
the great engineer and inventor.</p>

<p>Professor H. Helmholtz, whose works on tone
Ole Bull had carefully studied, says of the violinist
in a letter written in May, 1881:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I saw that he was thoroughly well informed as to the
mechanical problems concerning the violin, which came
in question.... I was much impressed by his personal
character; he was at the same time so enthusiastic and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
so intelligent, interested in all the great problems of
humanity.</p></div>

<p>The pleasantest incident of his concert tour in
the season of 1871&#8211;72 was a visit he made to his
friend, Mr. William H. Seward, in Auburn, N. Y.
The two delightful days spent at Mr. Seward&#8217;s
house relieved the tedium of the whole trip.</p>

<p>The summer of 1872 he was in Norway, and
in the fall returned again to the United States,
giving some seventy&#8211;five concerts, with his usual
success, during the winter. The last concerts announced
were given up, on account of the illness
of his infant daughter.</p>

<p>In the spring he returned to Norway, and occupied
for the first time the new house which
had been built at Lysö during his absence. The
winter following was mostly passed in Southern
France. While on a visit to Florence, he met
again his old friend Prince Poniatowsky, and also
many others whom he had known nearly forty
years before, when he had been made an honorary
member of the Philharmonic Society of that
city. Professor Sbolczis urged Ole Bull to permit
his friends to hear him, offering the aid of his
own orchestra; and not only the importunity of
his friends, but the thought of again trying his
power over such an audience as the city of the
Arno can offer, tempted him to play. The hall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
was crowded, the tickets having been taken by
storm, and the performers suffered considerable
inconvenience therefrom. But to this an Italian
readily accommodates himself under such circumstances.</p>

<p>Brizzi, the leader of the &#8220;Orfeo,&#8221; now claimed
that what Ole Bull had done for Sbolczis should
also be granted to his celebrated band of performers,
and offered to secure for the concert the
largest hall in the city, one that could hold nearly
five thousand people. Ole Bull consented, and
the greatest enthusiasm prevailed. In the orchestra
sat old men who had accompanied Paganini&#8212;&#8220;And
here he is again,&#8221; they cried. The <i lang="it">Corriere
Italiano</i> said of the concert:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Teatro Pagliano yesterday presented an imposing
scene. Every part was full to overflowing. The
most distinguished families and the ladies of the highest
circles, including the Grand Duchess Marie of Russia,
whose frequent applause showed how intensely she
enjoyed the music, were present at the concert; also
Commodore Peruzzi and wife, Princess Carolath, Princess
Strozzi, and an immense number of musical amateurs
of our artistic and aristocratic society.... The
chief honors of the concert were given to the Norse
Paganini, the original, inspiring, great violinist, Ole
Bull, who kindly contributed his valuable assistance,
and paid his respects to the &#8220;Orfeo.&#8221; His artistic nature
prompted him to this graceful act of fraternal courtesy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
the value of which is extraordinary, because he
himself is extraordinary,&#8212;he, the king of all violinists
of the present time, the old formidable rival of Paganini.
In the fantasy of the &#8220;Nightingale&#8221; he gave us
an idea of his charming and wonderful skill.... In
the &#8220;Carnival of Venice,&#8221; the frantic dance of the notes
combined with the most graceful execution could not
be excelled. Both pieces produced a storm of deafening
applause. The audience desired the latter repeated,
but, instead of this, the musician gave them the celebrated
fantasy of Paganini on the no less celebrated
song of Paisiello, &#8220;<span lang="it">Nel cor non più mi sento</span>,&#8221; and in
this we heard from Ole Bull the most secret beauties of
song, the sweetness of the flute, the transitions of the
violin to the viola, and to the sadness of the violoncello.
In the &#8220;<span lang="it">Polacca Guerriera</span>,&#8221; one of his own compositions,
burst forth the exciting and powerful notes of
war. As a composer he was graceful, wild, full of imagination,
feeling, and originality; as a performer he
was mighty, wonderful, indescribable. At this point a
golden wreath from the &#8220;Orfeo&#8221; was presented to Ole
Bull, while the audience applauded rapturously. The
old and handsome hero was visibly moved by the enthusiasm
which he had evoked.</p></div>

<p>He wrote of that evening:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>My violin did not fail me. I was never more thrilled
by its tone myself, and I cannot describe to you the
pitch to which the excitement ran, or the warmth of
my reception. I am so thankful that I have not disappointed
my old friends.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>From Florence he went to Rome to see Liszt,
and he found there quite a colony of his countrymen.</p>

<p>The year following was spent in Norway. He
had many vexations and troubles at that time;
but the hospitable cheer and ever&#8211;affectionate
welcome of his dear Lysekloster neighbors made
these easier to bear. During the summer he visited
the North of Norway&#8212;the &#8220;Land of the
Midnight Sun&#8221;&#8212;for the first time. That trip
was ever afterward a source of delightful reminiscences,
and, every successive winter, a repetition
of it for the coming summer would be suggested.
He used graphically to picture for us the morning
which gave him his first sight of the Lofoden
Islands: the changeful, illusive beauty of sea
and sky through the long day, every feature and
outline of isle and coast being sharpened or softened
by the play of brilliant light, now and then
dimmed by the fitful shadow of a fleecy cloud;
and how, towards midnight, all this culminated in
a glory indescribable, the warm prismatic colors
flooding sky and sea, not followed by twilight, but
kindled anew by the beams of the rising sun suddenly
shooting athwart the sky, the warmth and
glow at last giving way to the tender flush of
morning, and then to the white light of day.
Then, too, he would tell how his fellow&#8211;travelers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
mostly Englishmen, were <i>ennuied</i> and indifferent
the first days of the trip, but as they approached
the North, and felt the influence of the champagne&#8211;like
atmosphere, how they gradually yielded
themselves to the charm of a new sensation, becoming
social and even gay, some of them climbing
the shrouds like boys, and confiding to him
that they had never beheld a scene comparable
for beauty, or felt such exhilaration.</p>

<p>At one of the coast villages, which was so small
that a concert had not been thought of, they
found the whole population turned out, and, with
the recruits from the surrounding country, making
an imposing array on the quay, which was
decorated with evergreens and flags. Surprised
at such a welcome, the captain and passengers
good&#8211;naturedly agreed to wait till the concert
could be given. As the steamer, gay with flags
from stem to stern, passed out of the fjord, the
mountains echoed with the repeated shouts and
peals of cannon.</p>

<p>His countrymen received him everywhere with
the warm&#8211;hearted hospitality they know so well
how to dispense. But the dream of a repetition
of that trip was never realized. Three years later
he went as far north as Throndhjem, but mists
and rain prevented a continuation of the voyage.</p>

<p>The celebration of his birthday in 1876 deserves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
some mention here. The following account
is taken, with a few corrections, from Adolf
Ebeling&#8217;s &#8220;<span lang="de">Bilder aus Kairo</span>&#8221; (Stuttgart, 1878):&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On a beautiful September day in 1875, Ole Bull, by
invitation, visited Drotingholm, the charming summer
palace near Stockholm, and a favorite residence of the
queen. A fine park and inviting gardens separate it
from the busy world. Still it is only necessary to climb
the heights near by, and a glorious panorama is spread
out below. The bay of the Malar is seen filled with
islands, and the sea dotted with large and small sails;
and, on the other side, Stockholm itself, with its towers
and palaces, its forest of masts in the harbor, and the
dark&#8211;green mountains in the background.</p>

<p>The queen, now convalescent from a recent illness,
was giving no audiences, but had expressed a desire to
see the artist, and invited him to breakfast with the
royal family. While at table the queen happened to
mention Ole Bull&#8217;s &#8220;Saeterbesög,&#8221; her favorite composition.
He was on the point of telling her that it was on
the programme for one of his Stockholm concerts, but
a glance from the king checked him, as she was not
yet permitted the excitement of hearing music. At the
same moment his majesty laughingly suggested: &#8220;You
are about to undertake a new professional trip, Ole
Bull. Perhaps you will visit Egypt. What do you say
to playing the &#8216;Saeterbesög&#8217; on the top of the Pyramid
of Cheops? Nothing of the kind has ever been done,
and it seems to me that the idea might tempt a virtuoso.&#8221;
Ole Bull accepted the plan heartily, and the king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
further suggested the 5th of February, the artist&#8217;s
birthday, as an appropriate time for the pyramid&#8211;concert.
On taking leave, the royal pair most warmly
wished him all success on his trip, especially the Egyptian
portion of it.</p>

<p>After playing in Copenhagen, Berlin, Stettin, Hamburg,
Lübeck, and Bremen, awakening the same enthusiasm
as of old, we find him on the last day of January,
1876, in Brindisi, taking passage for Egypt, accompanied
by an impressario and his pianist, the young Emil
Bach. The trip was a pleasant one. At early dawn on
the 4th of February Ole Bull stepped on shore at Alexandria,
determined to carry out the &#8220;royal idea,&#8221; as he
called it. The same evening he reached Cairo, where
the Swedish consul, to whom a telegram had been sent,
met him at the station and took him to his hospitable
home. Early the next morning, the 5th of February,
several carriages were ready before the villa of the consul,
who had sent word in haste to a few friends to invite
them to share the trip; and about ten o&#8217;clock the
party found themselves at the Pyramids, the goal of Ole
Bull&#8217;s journey. Some of the company were to ascend
the Pyramid, and some to remain below; the latter
were in the minority, and were mostly ladies with a few
elderly gentlemen. The oldest of all was Ole Bull himself,
but he had already mounted the first ten blocks of
the huge structure alone and unaided. The powerful
son of the Norse mountains, to whom, in his boyhood,
no crag or peak was too high to be scaled, declared
that, in spite of the sixty&#8211;six years which he was celebrating,
he should be ashamed to have foreign arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
help him to the top. But the carrying up of his violin
was a matter of great concern and anxiety to him.
Wrapped in a silk handkerchief, it was intrusted to one
of the most stalwart of the Bedouins, and the bow, protected
in the same way, was given to another muscular
fellow. After a quarter of an hour&#8217;s climb, Ole Bull
stood first of all upon the small world&#8211;famed plateau,
and greeted the Norse flag which the consul had had
raised there. Gradually the rest of the guests came
also; but from all sides clambered and crowded the
Bedouins, for the report had quickly circulated that a
king of the North had sent a player down to the Pyramids.
Had they known of it in Cairo, the tourists
would certainly have flocked thither in crowds.</p>

<p>Ole Bull had now taken his violin and given two
powerful strokes to assure himself that it was in good
condition after its dangerous journey. He then drew
himself up to his full height, and let his penetrating
glance wander along the horizon for a few moments, to
scan the wonderful scene below. At his right lay the
valley of the Nile with its bright green fields stretching
into vanishing distances, the waves of that broad, majestic
stream gleaming like molten silver; to the left
lay great, boundless, golden deserts and the Libyan
Mountains; before him, at his feet, he had the wide&#8211;spreading
city of the khedive, with its minarets, domes,
and palm&#8211;gardens, all bathed in the brilliant sunlight.
Now he suddenly began to play a hymn of praise, as it
seemed; it was like a cry of joy to the Fates who had
vouchsafed him to stand there and to behold, with his
own eyes, the magnificent picture, the goal of so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
desires. Then he turned towards his home in the
North, and began his own mountain&#8211;song, the &#8220;Saeterbesög&#8221;....
In the pure, calm air of this height,&#8212;the
loftiest of all structures made by human hands,&#8212;the
tones were so clear and penetrating, and at the same
time so powerful, that we felt ourselves moved as by
magic power and thrilled to our inmost souls; then,
again, they wailed like soft maiden voices&#8212;it was the
home longing, the cry to the Norway mountains; and
then, again, we heard the hero&#8217;s song of triumph, proud
of his beautiful fatherland.</p>

<p>As Uhland makes the Münster Tower shake when
the young Goethe writes his name upon it,&#8212;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Von seinem Schlage knittern</span><br />
<span class="i2">Die hellen Funken auf,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Den Thurm durchfährt ein Zittern</span><br />
<span class="i2">Vom Grundstein bis zum Knauf,&#8221;&#8212;</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>so those tones must have reverberated to the centre
of this royal grave of six thousand years within the
Pyramids. And that this beautiful, poetic moment
should lack nothing, there rose, just as the master gave
the last strokes of his bow, two majestic pelicans from
the valley of the Nile, which swept with the silvery
sheen of their wings towards the north, as if they would
take the message of this happy event to Ole Bull&#8217;s
home. The Bedouins, children of nature, who, during
the playing, lay in a circle, motionless as fallen statues,
sprang up when the master had finished, as if electrified,
and shouted aloud and repeated &#8220;Allah! Allah!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus Ole Bull had kept his promise. Returning to
Cairo he telegraphed the king, and the next forenoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
received the royal reply. The telegrams were as follows:&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;To King Oscar, Christiania, Norway,&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;According to my promise at Drotingholm, I played,
on this my sixty&#8211;sixth birthday, on the top of Cheops&#8217;
Pyramid, in honor of Norway and its beloved king, my
&#8216;Saeterbesög.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The king answered:&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you heartily for your telegram, and the
queen and myself are rejoiced at all your successes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The artist&#8217;s singular journey to the Pyramids was
soon known in Cairo, and the khedive, during an audience,
complimented him on his courage and youthful
strength. Ole Bull gave a concert at the Opera House,
and harvested laurels, flowers, wreaths, and poems.
His &#8220;Tarentella&#8221; and &#8220;Carnival of Venice&#8221; were especially
admired. He played them with unwonted fire,
accompanied as he was by the admirable Italian orchestra,
under the leadership of his old friend Bottesini;
but his Norse &#8220;Saeterbesög&#8221; was not heard again.</p></div>

<p>Ole Bull returned to America in time to visit
the great Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia.
Offers from managers came at once, desiring him
to appear in concerts. He arranged with local
managers in the principal cities, and he never
assumed again the burden of his own concert
company. His engagements were made on a
new plan, which relieved him of all responsibility
outside his own performances. The time had
come when it seemed right that his own comfort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
and pleasure should be the first consideration.
He played by contract never more than three
times a week, and the hours for travel were limited.
It is but just to mention in this connection
that all the engagements filled from 1876 to 1880
were satisfactory as to the management and courtesy
of the gentlemen who arranged for his concerts,
and he had the pleasure of being associated
with many distinguished artists.</p>

<p>He first appeared in Music Hall, Boston, and
after an absence of six years the audience seemed
most kindly determined to convince him of their
warm welcome. As he entered they rose to their
feet, and the applause was long continued. He
gave that season, in Boston, nine concerts to
crowded houses, and the great desire of the public
to hear him so often was a surprise and a
pleasure to him. One occasion should be specially
mentioned.</p>

<p>The great interest which he felt in the recognition
of the Norsemen&#8217;s discovery of America,
not only in and for itself, but because it may have
given a hint to Columbus, who visited Iceland,
made Ole Bull desire to bring this subject before
the people of Boston; and an invitation signed by
many gentlemen, prominent in social, political,
and literary circles, urging him to give one more
concert, afforded him an opportunity of doing this.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
The matter was therefore talked over with friends,
and subsequently a committee was appointed for
the erection of a monument to Leif Ericsson,
commemorative of the event.</p>

<p>It is hoped that this undertaking is to be carried
out and completed in the near future. Ole Bull&#8217;s
friends know how earnest he was in promoting it;
and in Mr. Thomas G. Appleton, the chairman of
the committee, he found a liberal and enthusiastic
helper. Many others, beside his own countrymen,
were interested in the plan, as will be seen from
the remarks made by Rev. Edward Everett Hale
at the concert, and reported below.</p>

<p>The concert was given in Music Hall, which
was elaborately and tastefully decorated for the
occasion. Mr. Curtis Guild, who introduced the
artist, said:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have been deputed by his Excellency Governor
Rice, his Honor Mayor Cobb, and other members of
the committee, with whom I have the honor to be associated,
to present to you one of whom it with truth may
be said that he needs no introduction to a Boston audience....
From the commencement of his career in
this country, when an entranced audience listened to his
wonderful melody at the Melodeon, in May, 1844, to the
present time, a period of more than thirty years, the citizens
of Boston, more especially those of musical culture,
have recognized Ole Bull as a great musical artist, and
one whose composition and performance commanded
the tribute that only true genius can exact....</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>Ole Bull&#8217;s reply in acknowledgment of his reception
was thus reported in the <i>Daily Advertiser</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Ladies and Gentlemen</span>,&#8212;I see here among the audience
stars of the first magnitude. Why should they
address me? What am I that I can stand before this
audience and address such stars as these? I am but an
atom of failure in the universe; yet you are all united
with me in that failure in that you have indorsed me.
You belong to me and I belong to you. [Applause.]
But to explain to you the relation in which I stand here,
and the names you see about me [referring to the names
Thorvald, Thorfinn, Leif, and Washington], and how
they are connected together, I allow myself to say a
few words. Everybody in this audience knows that in
the year 984 Bjarne sailed to meet his father in Greenland.
He was driven south, and after a long voyage
came at last to a beautiful land, which he went back and
reported he had seen. Fourteen years after, in 1000,
his son, Leif Ericsson, took his ships and proceeded to
seek that land; and he came along by Newfoundland
and the coast of Nova Scotia, and further down to what
he called Vineland, because he found vines there. He
remained the fall and winter there, and then sailed back
again to Iceland. Then two years after, his brother
Thorvald went over and met his death near Martha&#8217;s
Vineyard. In 1831 they discovered his body in armor.
His body was taken to Boston, and the armor was analyzed,
and they found it was the same metal that the
Norsemen had used in the ninth and tenth centuries.
It had the same ornaments they had used, so there could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
be no doubt to whom it belonged. But, unfortunately,
the armor was lost by fire, and that calamity which we
both share together was an atom of fate that clings
to us. You lost the armor, but there was one who
could give it to posterity, and I say, almost to eternity,
and that was our illustrious star, Longfellow. [Applause.]
It was given for him to do it in his &#8220;Skeleton
in Armor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now what connection has the name of Thorfinn to
Washington? Washington not only belongs to the whole
world of the present generation, for that would be little
to say,&#8212;he belongs to all future generations. What
you educate is not for you alone, but it is for the whole
world. The name of Washington stands as the greatest
pinnacle of glory. It signifies liberty, it signifies every
thing that ennobles man. [Applause.] We find in the
recent discoveries concerning his ancestors, that they
came over in a ship, but that his ancestors&#8217; name was
Thorfinn. Well, Thorfinn is a Norwegian name, and it
is not very easy to see how Thorfinn could be changed
to Washington. But we see every day that strangers
come here, and after some little time they change their
names to some other taken from the new surroundings.
We see it in Norway, often, that a man who has taken
a new farm takes his name, not from the ancient farm
but the new farm. And this is the connection of the
ideas which prompted me to come here to&#8211;night and
have the honor to reply to the memory of Washington
and the memory of the Revolution, which delivered not
only America from oppression, but the whole world.
Now I beg leave to take my instrument in order to explain
the rest.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>After an account of the concert, during which
the artist &#8220;seemed stirred, by the sympathy of
his hearers, to a sympathy, intensity, and vividness
of style unwonted even to himself,&#8221; the <i>Advertiser</i>
continues:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Near the close of the performance, the Rev. E. E.
Hale rose in his place on the floor, and said he supposed
it was known to every person present that the distinguished
artist had spent almost the whole of his active
life in knotting those ties which connected his country
with ours. It was hoped that in some future time there
would be erected a physical memorial to the early discoverers
of whom he had spoken. It was the wish of
those about him [Mr. Hale], at whose request he spoke,
that Boston should not be behind in any expression of
gratitude to him [Ole Bull] for his work, as well as in
expressing interest in our Norse ancestors. He was
sure he spoke the mind, not only of the audience, but
of all New England, when he spoke of the interest
with which he regarded his countrymen, whom they
regarded as almost theirs. He remembered, although
it was nearly forty years ago, when much such an audience
as he saw about him cheered and applauded
Edward Everett, when the early discoveries had just
been made, and, when in one of the last of his public
poems he expressed the wish that the great discoveries
of Thorvald might be commemorated by Thorvald&#8217;s
great descendant, the Northern artist, Thorwaldsen.
The last words of that poem as it died upon the ear
were,&#8212;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Thorvald shall live for aye in Thorwaldsen.&#8221;</span><br />
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>He, the speaker, thought it was a misfortune for New
England that the great northern artist died before he
could accomplish this wish. But New Englanders had
never forgotten it, and had never forgotten their Norse
ancestors. It was an enterprise which ought to engage
Massachusetts men,&#8212;the preservation of a physical
memorial of Thorvald, Leif, and Thorfinn,&#8212;and he
suggested that the committee which had arranged the
meeting should become a committee of New England,
in conjunction with Mr. Appleton, to take this matter
in special charge. Mr. Hale put a motion to this effect,
and it was carried, and the committee constituted.</p></div>

<p>The holidays of that year were memorable.
Thanksgiving found Ole Bull at the home of
Professor Horsford in Cambridge, and he shared
the Christmas cheer of Craigie House with the
beloved poet; while on New Year&#8217;s Eve, he
watched the old year out and the new in with a
few friends in the library of James T. Fields.</p>

<p>In the early months of that year he made an
engagement for thirty concerts with his friend,
Mr. Maurice Strakosch. He first gave four concerts
at Steinway Hall, in New York, and had
the honor of being assisted by Madame Essipoff.
The <i>New York Herald</i>, of March 4, 1877, said:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Age seems to have been contented with scattering
snow upon his head, leaving untouched the fire of his
genius. The lithe and agile figure has lost none of its
elasticity, and the nerves are as steady as in the noon&#8211;day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
of life. There is still the same nervous delicacy of
touch and precision of execution, which, in the years
gone by, charmed two continents and led the people
of many lands in pleasant bondage after the car of the
enchanting musician. The triumphs of to&#8211;day are destined
to be no less great than those obtained in the past.
Ole Bull, like a prince that had wandered from his own
land and returned after a long absence, is restored to
the throne he had abandoned by a delighted people;
the memory of his great feats is not forgotten.</p></div>

<p>The New York audiences were remarkable for
their size, as were those in the cities he visited
east, south, and west. Miss Emma Thursby was
now associated with him, and this first acquaintance
with that great and charming artist resulted
in a warm, personal friendship. The very last engagement
Ole Bull filled was in conjunction with
Miss Thursby, who was, he hoped, to accompany
him to Norway, where he desired to present her
himself to his countrymen; but, overtaken by the
last fatal illness in England, he was so weak on
reaching home that waiting friends were advised
of the impossibility of even a visit. The following
summer, Miss Thursby paid a most loving and
tender tribute to her departed friend, by visiting
Ole Bull&#8217;s birthplace to add her generous gift to
the memorial his countrymen are to erect, and
won for herself the admiration and the affection of
the Northmen, as she had that of Ole Bull before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>The press notices are reminders of the large
audiences of 1876, and the pleasure manifested
at the efforts of the artists. In some places,&#8212;in
Brooklyn and Philadelphia, for instance,&#8212;not
only the audience&#8211;room was filled to overflowing,
but hundreds of extra seats were placed upon
the stage, while large numbers were turned away.
Describing such a scene, the Philadelphia <i>Press</i>
said:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And when Ole Bull appeared, what a right royal
shout of welcome he received! The wind waves almost
could be felt, and the applause could be heard blocks
away.... There is yet the delicacy of touch and the
wondrous power that tells of genius without loss of
lustre, and of the marvelous sympathetic instrumentation
of his brightest years. Nardini&#8217;s Sonata was the
first selection, and it was superbly played.... The
concert throughout was a most brilliant success, and
may fairly rank as one of the great events in the musical
history of Philadelphia.</p></div>

<p>To the last, these great audiences welcomed
Ole Bull in the Philadelphia Academy, under the
able management of Mr. Pugh.</p>

<p>The entire season was to the violinist an enjoyable
one, since he was in perfect health and condition
for his work. He had time to see his
friends and to visit them, playing, as he did, at
intervals only. He renewed many of the intimacies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
he had formed on his first visits to this
country, which incessant work in previous years
had compelled him, against his wish, to drop;
and he found that he was not only not forgotten,
but even better loved than he had thought.</p>

<p>After finishing his series of concerts, and only
three days before his departure for Europe, a request
came, signed by many distinguished names
in New York, asking for still another appearance.
He played, on the evening before he sailed, in
Booth&#8217;s Theatre, to a very full house, the stage
and boxes being occupied by his friends. The
artists were all inspired to do their best, and,
after the &#8220;Ave Maria&#8221; of Gounod had been sung
by Miss Thursby with Ole Bull&#8217;s obligato, the
audience seemed more determined than ever to
recall the artist and to demand familiar airs.
After the sixth encore he made a little speech,
but it was not until he had responded to the
tenth recall, for which he had given, &#8220;We won&#8217;t
go home till morning,&#8221; that the audience, with
the last waving of handkerchiefs and cheers, said
good&#8211;by. Later, at a little supper at the hotel,
the paper written by Dr. Crosby (printed in the
Appendix to this volume) was produced and read
for the first time&#8212;a surprise to Ole Bull. This
labor of love so generously given when it meant
hours of toil to an already overworked physician,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
with illness at home, was the crowning kindness
of the many showered upon him by loving
friends. No man ever filled a larger place in Ole
Bull&#8217;s heart than Professor R. Ogden Doremus,
who was present, and had made Dr. Crosby
known to the artist; and how he wished that he
might carry the two with him to his own beloved
Norway, when they bade him good&#8211;by the next
morning on the deck of the steamer! He felt
a concern for Dr. Crosby&#8217;s health which proved
only too well founded, for in June came the sad
news of his death, the result of overwork.</p>

<p>The Atlantic voyage was a rest in itself, for
sea&#8211;sickness was unknown to Ole Bull, and he
was a good person to cheer others who were unhappy
on shipboard. The inevitable concert
would be given the last evening of the voyage,
and often on very stormy passages he had played
to make others forget the fear and discomfort of
the hour.</p>

<p>The summer of 1877 was quietly spent in Norway,
and the winter was passed on the Continent
in travel. In Brussels, among the friends who
called on the artist was Vieuxtemps, then suffering
from the effects of a paralytic stroke. When
he would himself try Ole Bull&#8217;s instrument his
poor, numb hand could not obey his will; and at
last he exclaimed, as he handed it back, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>&#8220;&#8217;Tis no
use, I <i>cannot</i> command my fingers!&#8221; His talk
concerning style, composition, and virtuosity was
most interesting, as were also the incidents of
travel which he recalled. He said of Mendelssohn
and Schumann, &#8220;<span lang="fr">Ils sont virtuoses parce
qu&#8217;ils connaissent à fond leur art; ils sont virtuoses
parce qu&#8217;ils sont de grands poètes. Ils le
sont parce qu&#8217;ils ont le génie. Virtuosité, génie,
sont deux termes à peu près synonymes, deux
notions presque identiques</span>.&#8221; Vieuxtemps&#8217;s indignation
at the constant abuse of the term may
be imagined.</p>

<p>Ole Bull had planned to go to Italy and Sicily
for the winter, as he had long desired to revive
and live over again the memories of his first
visits to that sunny clime; but on his reaching
Vienna in January, the time from week to week
passed so delightfully, and old friends were so
cordial, that all thought of going further south
was given up. He had not intended to appear in
public, and did so on a few occasions only. The
general interest taken in his visit there and elsewhere
by the press and the people surprised him.
He busied himself while in Vienna with repairing
violins for friends, with so much success that his
acquaintances would urge him to direct the work
on their instruments, which they wished adjusted
according to his method, and he could seldom refuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
such a request. It sometimes seemed as if
he were happier at work on an old decrepit fiddle,
which he saw could be restored, than when
playing on his own superb instrument.</p>

<p>While in that city he celebrated with friends
the birthday of Madame Mathilde Marchesi.
Among the guests at the musical party was Madame
Christine Nilsson, and the hostess told with
pride of a telegram she had just received from
her favorite pupil, Gerster, whose brilliant success
in America she predicted.</p>

<p>Nilsson recalled how when a little girl she had
been admitted by the stage&#8211;door to one of Ole
Bull&#8217;s concerts in Sweden, and how, while the
artist stood talking to a friend, she had asked to
look at his violin, which he left in her hands
when called away for a moment. On venturing
to draw the bow she found to her delight that it
&#8220;almost played itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The courtesy of Mr. Joseph Hellmesberger,
Kapelmeister, with whom the artist played in
public, was an incident of his stay which he remembered
with much pleasure.</p>

<p>A visit was made to Pesth, where each day was
sure to bring a charming note or thoughtful message
from Liszt, whose kindly face often looked
in upon his friend. The following missive was
sent on the morning before Ole Bull left the
city:&#8212;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mon Illustre</span>,&#8212;Je vous prie amicalement de passer

<p>On se réunit à 9 heures.</p>

<p>(Il n&#8217;y aura pas de &#8220;violon&#8221; ni même de piano.)</p></div>

<p>At midnight, however, the violin was sent for
at Liszt&#8217;s request, and not till after two o&#8217;clock
in the morning did the company disperse. The
walk to the hotel along the fine river embankment
in the brilliant starlight, with the wonderful
tones still sounding in one&#8217;s brain, cannot be forgotten.
After a brilliant improvisation on the
same motives which Ole Bull had chosen for the
violin, Liszt had closed with a dreamy, tender
nocturne.</p>

<p>The master&#8217;s real interest in his friend&#8217;s work
was shown by his chiding him with warmth for
the state of his musical manuscripts which he insisted
on looking through, and which he earnestly
entreated him to prepare for publication.</p>

<p>The following note brought Liszt himself in
answer, and the last adieux were said:&#8212;</p>

<p>A month at the baths in Wiesbaden, where
friends made the stay most pleasant, and a summer
in the Norse home, followed. That summer
home&#8211;coming was always a delight to Ole Bull.</p>

<p>The grand old mountains, weird and forbidding
in the early spring storms but glorified by
the Northern summer, called him, and he heard.
The beloved Lysekloster valley, whose wooded
slopes commanded the fjord, the sea, the islands,
and the great range of the Hardanger; the road
his childish steps had trod, winding its way down
to the sea from the church of the old ancestral
home, at every turn giving a picturesque glimpse
of lake or cliff; the path shaded by birches and
maples, and the fields fragrant with wood violets
and lilies&#8211;of&#8211;the&#8211;valley; the cottagers at work, the
red jackets of the women and caps of the men
giving a dash of color here and there; the workers
shouting their respectful &#8220;welcome back&#8221; as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
hurries down to the boat waiting to carry him to
his own enchanted isle,&#8212;this was the picture
which lured him every spring, and when realized
gave him the happiest moment of the year.</p>

<p>From his eighth year he had loved Lysekloster,
and often said that he would choose that of all
places in the world for his home. In 1872 the
estate was divided on the death of the owner, and
the mansion itself came into the possession of a
friend and schoolmate of Ole Bull, who, at his
suggestion, bought the island opposite and decided
to make a new home for himself there,
thus fulfilling his boyish dream. The island had
hardly been explored or its rocky shores visited
by those living on the main land. Its tall pines
had grown and rocked in the winds alone; its
sod, except in one little spot, had never been
broken; its lakes mirrored only the stars and
clouds. From the foundation of the cloister on
the main land seven hundred years before, it had
been noted only as furnishing some of the largest
and finest trees in the neighborhood for building
purposes; but fortunately it was still well
wooded with pine.</p>

<p>A visitor would find Ole Bull while there interested
chiefly in the subject of drainage, the
care of trees, and the grading of roads and paths,
which he had himself laid out; strewn with white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
sea&#8211;shells they could be seen from a height circling
the lakes and opening up the island in
every direction.</p>

<p>The little steamer gliding into the fjord at
breakfast time seldom failed to bring one or more
guests from town. Old or young, they were
taken on walks of exploration about the island,
and even the oldest were sure to catch the enthusiasm
of their host. If fretted by a guidance
which did not spare them a short cut over rough
ground, down ravines and along never&#8211;ending
turns of paths, so confusing that it was impossible
to return alone, they forgave him later, when
in his music they learned what such a walk had
been to him.</p>

<p>The autumn days were the days for study.
The guests had then gone, and sometimes a week
of storm would succeed the brightest sunshine,
and dark nights suddenly replace the long twilight.
The walks then were to the farthest points
out towards the sea, where the ocean symphony
sounded loudest; the paths must also be explored
to protect them from the miniature waterfalls
overleaping their proper channels, or to save tree
or shrub from the flood which threatened its destruction;
but the fiercest storms could not disturb
the tranquil lakes guarded by the pine&#8211;clad
cliffs which furnished a quiet retreat on those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
wild walks. Then came the contrast of the cozy
room brightly lighted, and the tempting delicacy,
or, better still, the old&#8211;fashioned dish reserved
for such times by the faithful Martha.<a name="Anchor-23" id="Anchor-23"></a><a href="#Footnote-23" class="Anchor" title="Go to footnote 23.">[23]</a> How he
enjoyed it all! The music&#8211;room cheerful with
wood&#8211;fires and candles, while the storm without
promised seclusion, tempted him to do the best
work, often far into the night. When the fire
and candles had burned low, and the shadows
seemed the intruding spirits of the storm, then
the notes would be thrown aside, and that wonderful
instrument, a soul in the hand of its
master, would voice the tempest outside and the
peace within. Never did the picture of him
drawn by Longfellow in the &#8220;Tales of the Wayside
Inn&#8221; seem more strikingly true than in that
room and at that hour:&#8212;</p>

<p>The future held for Ole Bull the rare fortune
of being for one happy winter the neighbor of
Mr. Longfellow.</p>

<p>Lingering as long as possible till there was
but the shortest time to meet appointments, Ole
Bull sailed from Norway in the fall of 1878 for
the United States. So far as concerts were concerned,
there is but the same story of a cordial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
reception by the public and a pleasant winter.
A few brief extracts from the many notices in the
journals will suffice. He played in the principal
Northern cities only.</p>

<p>The Boston <i>Journal</i> said of him:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ole Bull seems not a day older than he did a score of
years ago, and certainly he has not lost a whit of his
wonderful command over the violin.</p></div>

<p>The New York <i>Herald</i> of December 15th said
in a long article:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Taken as a whole, the art of the great virtuoso is distinctive,
original, and full of rugged strength. It may
be truly said of him that he is the poet of the violin,
especially when illustrating his own splendid compositions.</p></div>

<p>And the <i>Tribune</i> remarked:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>His fervid nature and personal magnetism are as
powerful as ever, and he sways the audience of to&#8211;day
pretty much as he did their fathers and mothers, in
spite of the fact that critical taste is not always satisfied
with his methods.</p></div>

<p>The &#8220;Violin Notes,&#8221; now first published, were
written out that season, during the holidays, and
he was experimenting on and developing the
chin&#8211;rest.</p>

<p>The following characteristic anecdotes were related
by a Brooklyn gentleman who called on Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
Colton to meet Ole Bull, and was shown to the
door of the model work&#8211;shop. He writes:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I knocked, at first hesitatingly, lest I might disturb
the quiet that reigned within, broken only by the tones
of Ole Bull&#8217;s violin. Taking advantage of a pause, I
knocked again, this time to be admitted by Mr. Colton,
who forthwith presented me to the violinist. All my
fear and embarrassment as to my reception were at
once expelled by the pleasant greeting. His countenance
was lit up by that same genial smile so well
known to us all.... He explained that Mr. Colton
was at work upon his famous Gaspar da Salo, while he
was practicing on his beautiful Nicholas Amati. He
seemed in such capital spirits that I ventured to ply
question upon question, and all were answered with a
perfect grace and simplicity. On his asking whether I
had attended his last concert at the Academy of Music
in Brooklyn, I replied, regretting my own engagement
to play at a <i>soirée musicale</i> the same evening. &#8220;You
play? What did you play at the soirée?&#8221; &#8220;&#8216;L&#8217;Elegie&#8217;
by Ernst.&#8221; &#8220;What, do you play that? Here,&#8221; handing
me his precious violin, &#8220;you shall play what I could
not hear that night, and I will play for you what you
could not hear.&#8221; With great caution and greater reluctance
I took the fine Amati, and the studded diamonds
seemed to laugh at me from the keys they adorned. I
had not proceeded far when he suggested a different
interpretation of one of the weird phrases of that composition.
I yielded and tried to express his idea, but,
failing completely, handed him the instrument, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
eagerness watched the movement and with better result.
He then took the violin, straightened himself,
and played the Paganini Concerto as I have never
heard it played. He seemed completely lost to the
surroundings. The very notes ring in my ears as I
now think of that performance. Speaking of the German
school of violinists, he objected to their heavy and
coarse style of interpretation, saying, &#8220;The German
plays his violin conveniently; that is, he would not
play the larghetto in <i>la</i> of Mozart on the D and A
strings, but use the E for the A when convenient and
A for D, and thus spoil the most beautiful of melodies.&#8221;
When I asked who was his favorite composer,
he quickly exclaimed: &#8220;Mozart, yes, Mozart, and more,
he is the most difficult composer to interpret.&#8221; I remonstrating
gently, saying that I thought his melodies
were easily written, as stated by Mozart himself, and
more easily understood than a Beethoven composition,
he replied warmly, &#8220;Just so; because so easy and
graceful, the more noticeable are the breaks of coarse
interpreters, as, for instance, in their poor modulation
in changing from one string to another.&#8221; I must confess,
his illustration on the violin corroborated his theories.
Referring to Paganini, he said that it was next to
impossible to play any one of his compositions as he
played them; and apropos of the silly stories circulated
throughout Europe during Paganini&#8217;s time, they were
simply the products of the conspiring minds of Lafont
and his musical friends, who but too keenly felt the superiority
of the dark Italian. &#8220;I shall never forget,&#8221;
he continued, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>&#8220;how Habeneck, the musical director,
told me of Paganini&#8217;s reception in Paris. When Paganini
went to rehearsal for the first concert, he was received
with great coolness by the orchestra who were
to accompany him. The first violins especially showed
their contempt for their rival by playing an <i>ensemble
pizzicato</i> movement for the left hand, as much as to say,
You are not the only man that can do that. But Paganini&#8217;s
quiet remark, &#8216;Gentlemen, you do not play in
tune; you had better practice scales before attempting
that,&#8217; so completely upset them that they made no further
efforts to discommode him. One of the tympani,
however, persisted in beating out of time, which so exasperated
Paganini that he shouted, &#8216;Wait, I&#8217;ll come
there and make you play right,&#8217; and started towards
him; whereupon the fellow beat a hasty retreat, to the
amusement of all as well as of Paganini himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ole Bull once admiring the ability with which Malibran
read music at sight, she challenged him, saying,
&#8220;You cannot play anything, be it ever so intricate, but
I can sing it after once hearing.&#8221; Ole Bull played a
caprice full of technical difficulties, but she sang it correctly;
and, said he, &#8220;I cannot, even at this day, after
forty&#8211;five or more years, understand how she did it.&#8221;
He played it and I confess it was a labyrinth of musical
phrases to me. And thus the afternoon glided away,
telling one anecdote after another. One which I am
about to relate will show the goodness of his heart:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>&#8220;I was announced to play at Hartford, Connecticut.
Arriving late in the afternoon I hurried to a barber&#8211;shop.
While I was getting shaved, the boot&#8211;black, a
colored boy, rattled off some lively tunes on a fiddle.
When I praised him he seemed pleased, saying, &#8216;Yes,
Mister, I can beat any man in Hartford.&#8217; Noticing how
he worked and stretched to gain the high notes, I
asked him if there were no other means of obtaining
them. He gave me a look as much as to say, &#8216;What
do you know about a fiddle any how?&#8217; adding that there
was no other way. I took his fiddle, and illustrated my
suggestion by playing harmonics. The boy stood with
open&#8211;mouthed wonder, and I, returning the instrument,
left the shop. On reaching the street above, I could
not refrain from looking down through the window.
There he sat scratching his head and then the violin,
the very picture of perplexity, trying to solve the mystery
of harmonics. I sent him a ticket to my concert.
After it was over I saw that negro boy standing in the
aisle, battling with himself whether to come forward or
not. I beckoned him, and with plaintive voice he said:
&#8216;Mister, can&#8217;t you come down to the shop to&#8211;morrow to
get shaved and show me those tricks? I feel powerful
bad!&#8217; I promised him I would, and I kept my word.&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The summer of 1879 was one of the happiest
ever spent by the artist in Norway. One memorable
day was when a party of friends went down
to the little hamlet Lofthus in the Hardanger, to
be immortalized, as Ole Bull told the peasants,
because the composer Grieg had chosen to stay
there for months and to write some of his best
works. They had now come to celebrate his
birthday. No spot could be more enchanting, so
wonderfully blended were the beautiful and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
sublime in nature. The little study of one room,
erected by the composer for perfect retirement,
was perched half way up a rock and near the
fjord. In the field above, the apple&#8211;trees were in
bloom about an old farm&#8211;house, where the guests
assembled. From the summit of the beetling
cliffs not far away fell a beautiful waterfall, while
the opposite mountain shore of the broad fjord,
clothed with heavy forests of pine above and the
feathery birch below, presented range after range
of lofty peaks and domes, crowned by the great
Folgefond with its eternal snow. The day was
as perfect as friendship, music, and lovely surroundings
could make it.</p>

<p>King Oscar and the young prince made a visit
to Bergen that summer, and Ole Bull was proud
of the escort of steamers, the crowds of honest,
sturdy peasant faces, the refined but hearty welcome,
and the imposing pageant which Bergen
presented in greeting their sovereign. While the
artist was standing on a height overlooking the
harbor, the procession and bands discovered his
presence as they moved along to take their position
and welcome the ship on its entrance to the
harbor with the royal guests; and each division
of the long line halted in front below, the bands
playing and the men cheering Ole Bull. This
instant recognition and spontaneous expression of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
regard was so constantly given him by his countrymen
that it deserves mention. He proudly
said that day that not another city in Europe
could furnish so royal an escort as the fleet of
steamers selected from the shipping in the Bergen
harbor. Certainly, none could have given a
more beautiful or loyal welcome. On the king&#8217;s
departure from Bergen, Ole Bull had, with the
city authorities, the honor of accompanying their
guests for one day along the coast. To the toast
at dinner proposed by Ole Bull for the royal
princes, in which, according to those present, he
eloquently referred to the royal family and to the
successive sovereigns whom he had personally
known, the king responded by singing the three
verses of Ole Bull&#8217;s &#8220;Saeterbesög.&#8221;</p>

<p>But only too soon came the time for departure
from his home. On the last day and evening
every part of the island was visited. It was in
truth a farewell, and it now seems as if the last
lingering looks rested with more than wonted
tenderness on the spot he so loved; for it was
the last time his foot pressed the soil, as on his
next return he was borne in the arms of others to
his home. His feeling for that scene is best expressed
by himself. He once wrote:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I have suffered so much,&#8212;no one knows how much,
but He whose everlasting, superhuman love you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
to sustain you in everything noble and elevated....
How I am longing for Norway, for Lysö! If you only
knew the beauty of the &#8220;Clostrûm vallis lucida,&#8221; as it
was called in the year 1146, you would pine for it. I
have never seen anything that attracts me so mysteriously;
so grand, so sweet, so sad, so joyous! I cannot
account for it. The atmosphere there has certainly a
rare charm, and the woods, the ravines, and the lakes
are so varied in expression; but the grand views from
the mountains must be seen with caution, or they will
overpower you; they make me feel thankful to God and
weep in prayer for all enemies and friends.</p></div>

<p>On his return to the United States in the fall
of 1879 it was decided to spend the winter quietly
with family friends, and a residence with
them was taken in Cambridge, Mass. It is pleasant
to dwell upon the charming intercourse that
made the months pass so swiftly, and two occasions
may be mentioned here. The first was
the celebration of Ole Bull&#8217;s seventieth birthday,
which has been so gracefully recalled by Mr. Appleton;
and the other, which came soon after,
was the seventy&#8211;third anniversary of Mr. Longfellow&#8217;s
birth, when he invited the artist with a few
friends to dine and spend the evening with him.
The beautiful presence of the poet was a benediction
to those about him; and this, the last evening
Ole Bull was with him, Mr. Longfellow, as it
is now pleasant to recall, seemed especially to enjoy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
A friend of the poet, who was present, sent
to the violinist just as he was to leave Cambridge
this sonnet, which was written while his playing
for Mr. Longfellow was still fresh in her memory:</p>

<div class="poem">
<h3>TO OLE BULL.</h3>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How full of music&#8217;s harmony and state</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thy presence is, ere inspiration stirs!</span><br />

</div>

<p>Among the valued letters written in answer to
the birthday summons was this pleasant response
from Mr. Whittier:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="letterhead">
<span class="smcap">Oakknoll, Danvers</span>, <i>2<sup>nd</sup> Mo. 1, 1880</i>.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mrs. Bull</span>,&#8212;I am extremely sorry that the
state of my health will not permit me the great pleasure
of calling on thee and thy gifted husband on the occasion
of his seventieth birthday. I have a happy memory
of meeting him some years ago and talking with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
him of his wonderful art. While it is a matter of regret
to me that I know little of music, and can scarcely
distinguish one tone from another, I am not insensible
of &#8220;the concord of sweet sounds,&#8221; and I know something
of the delight of those who &#8220;carry music in their
hearts.&#8221; I would be glad to join with those who are
able to testify in person their high regard for the great
musician, who, as one of the rare interpreters of poetry
and harmony, has made the world his debtor; and who
brings to us from his native land its voices and melodies,
the lapsing waves of its fjords, the storm&#8211;song of
the wind, the rustic of the birch groves, the murmur of
its pines and the laugh of children, and the low of cattle
and song of milk&#8211;maids on its summer mountains.</p>

<p>Give him the best wishes of one who is two years his
senior that, to use an Irish phrase, the years to come
may only bring &#8220;more power to his elbows&#8221; and make
him happy in making others happy.</p>

<p class="sig">
Very truly thy friend,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">John G. Whittier</span>.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Thomas G. Appleton&#8217;s account of the birthday
gathering is as follows:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">

OLE BULL&#8217;S SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY.
</p>

<p>The date, February 5, 1880, is a very memorable
one to many of us, for in some sense then we heard the
swan&#8211;song of the great Norwegian.</p>

<p>It was one of those impromptu <i>fêtes</i> which, when successful,
snatch a grace beyond the reach of art. Such
occasions have the freshness of a rose suddenly plucked,
with the dew and the bloom which disappear if kept
waiting too long. It was the seventieth birthday of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
Mr. Ole Bull, and soon after he left us for his native
land, never to return.</p>

<p>There was a little domestic conspiracy shared in
somewhat by outside friends to make this <i>fête</i> a pleasant
surprise to the object of it. The nearest intimates
of Mr. Ole Bull were summoned secretly and in time to
prepare their tributes of respect and affection, and the
scene of this gathering had memories of its own, suitable,
harmonious, and poetic. For Mr. Bull was then
living at Elmwood, the home of our present ambassador
to London, Mr. J. R. Lowell. In his drawing&#8211;room,
where pictures of J. R. Stillman, Christopher Cranch,
and other friends hung upon the paneled walls, there
was an aroma of scholarship, of wit and fancy, in keeping
with the old mansion, which shares with the residence
of Mr. Longfellow an old&#8211;time dignity, a colonial
pomp, as if to emphasize the genius of the poets with
the added charm of antiquity. Communicating with
the drawing&#8211;room is Mr. Lowell&#8217;s study. It was those
study&#8211;windows which gave the title of one of his pleasantest
books, and there indignation sharpened the shaft
of satire which made the humor of the &#8220;Biglow Papers&#8221;
a national event.</p>

<p>One by one in the fading twilight the friendly conspirators
arrived. Mr. Bull was detained by unsuspected
constraint in a neighboring family till the suitable
moment for his appearance arrived. He could
hardly have forgotten the date of so important an anniversary,
yet in the fine simplicity of his nature one
could see how unconscious he was of the delightful plot
in which he was involved. When it broke upon him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
little by little it was beautiful to witness the mild surprise,
the questioning astonishment, displaced by an
affectionate ardor and cordial recognition of its significance.
As the world knows, there is something fascinating,
individual, and characteristic in the countenance
of the great artist. Geniuses often, while most individual
themselves, are yet the highest expression of national
characteristics. Mr. Bull looked the mystic land
to which he owes his birth. Seeing him, one better
understood the Sagas which tell of the heroes who
launched, a thousand years ago, their galleys over
stormy seas to conquest. His smile, so sweet and genuine,
lingered round his mouth, as the sunshine sweetens
the northern valleys, while fancy could think it saw
in his streaming locks of silver the icy crests above or
the flickering of the pale aurora of the North. Among
the presents of this birthday was a violin wholly composed
of flowers, their harmonies, though silent, suggesting
in a fresh way the melodies which lingered in
the memory of all. A disk, also of flowers, displayed at
its centre the word &#8220;skaal,&#8221; the proper word for the
occasion. There were aquarelles and heaped&#8211;up baskets
of flowers, and whatever suitable gift individual
love prompted to bring. When the artist had received
our salutes and hand&#8211;shakings, and smiles had warmed
all with a common purpose, Ole Bull felt that he had
but one thing to do, to reply to the spoken and silent
messages of good&#8211;will in the language he loved best,&#8212;the
one best suited to the occasion. And, standing in
our midst, his snowy locks falling forward across his
bent and sympathetic face, he bade his violin speak for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
him. He played with his whole heart an answer, a
swan&#8211;song of melody, on which, as upon a great river,
we were carried away into dreamland, into the Valhalla
and the halls of Odin. His skill, the vigor and power
of his bow arm, belied the seventy years they celebrated.
Time had left as iron that wonderful right arm which
never could grow old. A distinguished artist answered
the violin with a voice into which was gathered the responsive
cordial enthusiasm of all, and with these two
musical expressions Mr. Ole Bull&#8217;s <i>fête</i> was accomplished.
Supper and the tumult of chat, laughter, and
content took off pleasantly the acute edge of excitement.
Then later we were summoned away from the
piano to the drawing&#8211;room, where a huge cake in frosted
sugar displayed the name and age of the great artist.
Amid much merriment it was cut and shared, each one
eagerly hunting for the symbolic tiny golden violin,
somewhere hid in its capacious flanks. When the little
treasure was discovered it was found to have most suitably
fallen to one of the oldest and dearest of friends,
who was, perhaps, the nearest neighbor of them all in
Cambridge. After the cake had been divided and the
golden violin discovered, a venerable bottle of Tokay
was produced, which Professor Horsford had brought
home from his Austrian sojourn: this liqueur&#8211;like wine
having been distributed in little glasses, Mr. Longfellow
proposed the health and happiness of Ole Bull, which
was drunk in a silence meaning more than words.</p>

<p>Thus ended a happy evening, a memorable birthday,
sacred now as the last communion of love and music,
between the poet of the North and that throng which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
could have been multiplied a hundred times over if all
those who have held in dear regard the great artist
could have found admittance to that little room.</p></div>

<p>In March and April Ole Bull appeared in a
few concerts in the principal Eastern cities with
Miss Thursby. His last appearance but one in
New York was for the benefit of the <i>Herald</i>
Fund for the starving Irish, at the request of Mr.
Edwin Booth, who planned and carried out most
successfully a dramatic and musical entertainment.
Good as was the cause, it was more for
the sake of the originator of the plan that Ole
Bull responded with pleasure. During that winter
he had the opportunity of giving the Boston
Philharmonic Society his assistance; and he also
played for the Philharmonic Association in Cambridge,
where he was honored by an audience that
might well inspire any artist to his best efforts.</p>

<p>Late in June, with a pleasant party of friends,
Ole Bull sailed the last time for Europe. He
had not been feeling well for a month before, but
the physicians consulted assured him that a sea&#8211;trip
was all that he needed to bring relief. The
first days out revived him somewhat, and no
anxiety was felt; but later, what seemed a violent
attack of sea&#8211;sickness, the first he had ever suffered,
reduced his strength. At Liverpool he revived,
and the physician thought a few days&#8217; rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
would quite restore him, but more violent symptoms
soon appeared, and great concern was felt
as to his being able to bear the journey to Norway,
on which he insisted when he found he was
not improving. Dr. Moore, of Liverpool, accompanied
him. The trip across the North Sea was
finally accomplished, but at great risk, and when
at last the little fjord steamer came alongside to
bear the invalid to his home, a prayer of thanksgiving
filled all hearts. As the steamer glided
gently onward the restful calm brought a sweet
sleep, and all the surroundings seemed to breathe
a promise of health. As Ole Bull approached
Lysö he wakened, and how earnestly, how gratefully
he gazed on his beloved mountains in
their calm majestic beauty at that early morning
hour! After the first day of exhaustion the sufferer
seemed to gain steadily, until a complete recovery
was looked for. Those days were full of
happiness and blessing.</p>

<p>Professor E. N. Horsford, a valued and dear
friend of many years, made his first and long&#8211;promised
visit to Norway that summer. His description
of the island and of the artist&#8217;s home&#8211;coming
was written shortly after. He says:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I first saw Lysö in the twilight of Norwegian mid&#8211;summer.
It was from the steamer Domino, on my voyage
across the North Sea from Hull, by way of Stavanger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
to Bergen. The island may have been seven or
eight miles away. Its irregular domes of dusky green
were but dimly outlined upon the bank of wooded
mountains beyond. It was too late to see clearly. Distant
objects had begun to look weird, and the sky was
shadowy. We were approaching the region of long
twilights&#8212;the kingdom of the midnight sun; besides,
the eyes were fatigued with the endless succession of
unfamiliar forms. All day we had been sailing along
inhospitable shores, and among rocky islands, scantily
covered with vegetation. Now and then, in less exposed
situations, fishing hamlets with sunny red roofs
had come in sight; we had taken in review the openings
into narrow fjords with opposing cliffs, and repeated
collections of runic columns, with the commanding
monument to Harold Haarfager, the first king of Norway.
All these were in the foreground, while in the
distant eastern horizon, spread upon the table&#8211;land and
covering the lofty mountain range, was the majestic glacier
of the Folgefond. These had challenged attention,
and in their novelty, or picturesqueness, or grandeur,
had fascinated us; but the spot about which the abiding
interest centred only came into view when it was
too late to more than make out its general position in
the Björne Fjord at the foot of the Lyshorn. Soon after
crossing the Björne Fjord, we swept past a column of
ships of the inward bound Loffoden fishing fleet, stern
and stately, with their antique prows and huge single
square sails; and entered the crowd of countless lesser
fishing vessels and iron steamers, and came to anchor
in the harbor of Bergen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>My next view of the island was from the little steamboat
landing near Lysekloster, the point on the mainland
where one takes boat for Lysö. The island is
scarcely more than half a mile from the wharf, and from
other points on the mainland the distance is less.</p>

<p>We had driven from Bergen, some eighteen miles
over a mountain road. Near the end, the way led down
past the ruins of Lysekloster, a relic of the eleventh
century, with its many remains of halls, refectory, chapter&#8211;house,
cloisters, rude stone coffins, and ruder inscriptions;
past the fine old mansion of the Nicolaysons,
whose estate shares the name of Lysekloster; past the
antique chapel, where the gathering peasant women still
wear a costume suggesting the monastery; down to the
wharf where we were to cross the narrow Lysefjord to
the home of Ole Bull. On our left, the high mainland
stretched away in a southerly direction for a mile or
more, and then turned sharply to the west beyond the
island. On the right, the bare, rocky headlands jutted
irregularly out for many miles toward the broad entrance
to the Björne Fjord. In a little bay under the
slope of the Lyshorn, and a few rods from the wharf,
giving a touch of surprising grace to the scene, were
two stately swans. This was, we learned, a favorite resort,
to which they made occasional excursions from
their island home. Immediately before us was Lysö, a
series of granite domes of unequal height, half covered
with birch and evergreen above, half carpeted with
heather and moss below. No trees had been felled.
There was scarcely a trace of disturbed surface except
in the narrow foot&#8211;paths that led up from the shore.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
There were two little wharves, one near the boat&#8211;house,
and low, red tile&#8211;roofed cottage of Haldor&#8211;Lysö, the
family servant; the other under the bluff on which
stood the imposing mansion of the proprietor.</p>

<p>Of other structures there were none on the island.
There were no beaches; there was no gravel. The
rocky cliffs of Norway, here as elsewhere, and uniformly,
rise almost with the sharpness of a wall from
the sea. If gravel there be at the foot of the precipices,
it must be far down in the water. Above, the pines and
spruces and feathery birches start from fissures in the
rocks, and soar away to great heights, giving to the
island a fleecy air of indescribable beauty, and to the
inner fjord the soft seclusion of an inland sea.</p>

<p>Across this sheet of water we were rowed by Haldor.
In the distance, the American and Norwegian flags
were waving their welcome. The deep green of the
Norway pines gave the finest relief to the Hall. It
stands upon a shelf. The first story leans against the
mountain. The second story, and the Byzantine turret
rising above the roof at the corner nearest the brow of
the bluff, are clearly defined against the dark foliage.</p>

<p>A large, open tower, with winding stairs midway on
the long side of the Hall, and rising from the ground
far above the eaves, gives, with its richly&#8211;decorated panels,
brilliant entrance to the reception room below and
the music hall above. The apartment devoted to music,
occupying the whole width of the house, with two
thirds of its length, and the entire height of the second
story to the roof, is finished throughout in unstained
spruce. Rows of slender clustered and twisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
columns rise to support an elaborate system of delicately
and curiously wrought arches. The two concert
grand pianos, embodying the inventions to which so
much thought had been given, and from which the inventor
hoped so much of advancement to the art, were
here.</p>

<p>Turkish and Persian carpets and rugs were spread
upon the floor or suspended between the columns. On
one side, the whispers of the mountain pines came in
through the open windows. Through the windows opposite
you saw the fjord and the highlands beyond in
undisturbed natural beauty. How fitting! In what
keeping with the spirit that inspired the whole! Without
and within, the perpetual fragrance of the balsam
and birch. Everywhere quiet; no rattle of carts, no
noise of hurrying trains, no hum of business. Everywhere
repose, only to be invaded by human voices or
music, or the soft lapping of the waves at the base of
the cliff, or the soughing of the south wind among the
swaying pines.</p>

<p>The shelf of rock on which the Hall stands is about
fifty feet above the water, and some two or three hundred
feet below the highest point on the island. Immediately
around the narrow plot which spreads out on the
sides and front is a dense border of roses and flowering
and decorative shrubbery; and along the retreating
slopes, here and there, room has been found for beds of
strawberries and small groups of fruit&#8211;trees. A quarter
of a mile northward is the cottage of the servant who
cares for the grounds and mans the yacht and row&#8211;boat.
Of roadways, properly speaking, there are none; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
bridle and foot&#8211;paths penetrate every part of the six
hundred acres of the island, winding in and out, and up
and down, through the dells and glens, and by the caverns,
for twenty miles or more in all, from the shores to
the summits of the highest peaks. As there are no
beaches, so there are no pebbles for walks, and the surface,
a coating of broken shells, is gathered from below
the sea, at some distant point, from which they were
brought in vessels. There are two little lakes nestling
among the hills, and there are two or three little meadows,
resting upon beds of peat, from which the product
is annually gathered.</p>

<p>Standing on one of the higher peaks of the island,
you look northward upon the Lyshorn, a bold, rocky
cone, skirted with evergreens, and lifting its bare summit
twelve hundred feet from the sea. At its foot are
the undulating meadows and picturesque group of Lysekloster.
On the west, the eye, glancing down the
Björne Fjord, takes in the chain of lofty, dark islands
beyond the channel pursued by the steamers approaching
Bergen from the south. On the east the mainland
half embraces the island, approaching at the nearest
point within a few rods of the bold cliffs that fall sheer
into the sea. On the south lies the broad entrance to
the Hardanger Fjord, the most extended, unique, and
famed of the Norwegian water highways.</p>

<p>A few days after our arrival at the island, the great
musician and sufferer was brought to his longed&#8211;for
home. The tender care of thoughtful kindred, and the
ever busy, lifelong friend of the family, Martha,<a name="Anchor-24" id="Anchor-24"></a><a href="#Footnote-24" class="Anchor" title="Go to footnote 24.">[24]</a> full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
affectionate solicitude, had made every needed preparation.
Gentle hands bore him on his couch from the
steamer to the centre of the grand music hall. Faint
and worn and weak, he was at last under his own roof.
How gratefully fell on his waiting sense every familiar
sound and form! Above and around him were the vistas
of arches and clustered columns he had planned; a
very Alhambra of fairy architecture. How often through
these galleries, in happier days, he remembered, had so
sweetly thrilled the strains of his favorite Gaspar da
Salo! There was the organ that later, at his wish,
yielded from the touch of love and anguish the sweet
requiem of Mozart. The windows, distantly screened by
oriental hangings, were open to the sympathetic trees,
whose incense was so full of the associations of youth
and the days of strength. The moan of the burdened
pines was hushed. Was it too much to hope there might
be, in this spontaneous recognition and welcome, the
breath of life to the prostrate friend? What air could be
more grateful than one&#8217;s native air, washed with all the
waves of the Atlantic, and surcharged with the balm of
the evergreens of Norway? Did the fevered invalid
need water to quench his thirst or to bathe his brow?
The freshly&#8211;fallen dew could not be purer or more clear
than the water that welled from Lysekilde, under the
rock a few rods away.</p>

<p>Was there a delicacy that affection or medical skill
could suggest or devise for a reluctant and fastidious
palate? Devotion and utmost culinary art had provided
for its instant preparation. Every attention that never&#8211;wearying
love and forethought could secure were bestowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
upon the dear sufferer. A few days in this
restful home so far revived his strength that he was
able to see the friends who had come to visit him; but
as the physician saw ground for believing that, with
absolute quiet, the lost health might be regained, the
stay was not prolonged.</p>

<p>During the visit a most touching incident occurred,
illustrating the tender affection felt for Ole Bull throughout
Norway. The annual encampment of militia troops
at Ulven, a few miles from Lysö, broke up. The regiments,
embarked upon a fleet of steamers, on their way
to Bergen, the point for disbanding, necessarily passed
a short distance outside of Lysö. The fleet was conducted
through the inner fjord, that opportunity might
be given to show the sympathy and affection of the
troops for the man whose music had so often entranced
them. The foremost vessel of the fleet, with the military
band, came slowly to rest immediately under the
windows of the music hall. Ole Bull, too feeble to present
himself, directed his great American flag with the
Norwegian arms in the escutcheon (the gift of the New
York Philharmonic Society) to be run out from the
window overlooking the fjord. Immediately the band
played with infinite sweetness an original composition
of the master. This was followed by a superb ancient
Norwegian air, to which Björnson had written the
words, and this was succeeded by the proud national
hymn. At the close, dipping its flag, the head of the
fleet silently moved away. The successive vessels
slowly following, dipped their flags in turn, and passed
on around the island to resume their course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>Alas! that this fleet should have been the herald of
the convoy of steamers that, a few weeks later, gave
such mournful and impressive dignity to the sorrow
of Norway, when the mortal remains of Ole Bull were
borne by sea to their last resting&#8211;place in Bergen, where
he was born.</p></div>

<p>A few days only after Mr. Horsford left came
the sudden change,&#8212;the loss of strength, and
the fear, on the part of those in charge of the
case, that the illness would prove fatal. Never
had a patient kinder physicians; Dr. Moore being
in constant attendance, and Dr. Wiesener,
of Bergen, in daily consultation. The sick one
bravely fought the disease at every step, and
calmly awaited the issue. It has been said of
another: &#8220;A devoted lover of religious liberty,
he was an equal lover of religion itself, not in
any precise dogmatic form, but in its righteousness,
reverence, and charity.&#8221; This was true of
Ole Bull. As his body weakened, his soul seemed
the stronger, &#8220;and full of endearment and hope
for humanity,&#8221; as Mr. Fields wrote of him. He
gave the sweet assurance that life had been precious
to him, and the dear smile lighted the way
for all, as he passed beyond. One who was present
wrote of that hour:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Everything made the change remarkably free from
the dark and terrible in death. The day was a beautiful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
quiet one, full of sunshine and gladness, and the fragrance
of flowers. You know how lovely the surroundings
are. I hope death may always seem to me as here,
a happy, peaceful ending of suffering, and a quiet passing
away into something nobler and better.</p></div>

<p>Another quotation from a letter written only
for the eyes of friends will give the public feeling
of the time and its expression:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>All honor is being paid our beloved by king and
people. The king sent a telegram of condolence to Mrs.
Bull, expressing his personal as well as the national
loss. The city is in mourning, with hundreds of flags
at half&#8211;mast, among them the royal standard. The
common council of Bergen at once met, and offered a
spot in the very centre of the old cemetery for the
place of burial. It is a beautiful location. The newspapers
are enclosed with broad lines of black, as never
before, except for members of the royal family, and contain
many tributes and accounts of his life.</p>

<p>On Friday last the Kong Sverre, one of the largest
of the coast steamers, came out with friends to see the
remains as they lay in state in the music room. On
Monday the funeral ceremonies took place, and honors
more than royal were indeed shown to our dear one.
It seemed that all the patriotism, all the love of people
and country, which have so characterized and distinguished
his nature during all his long life, wherever he
might have been, were now returned to him in this
spontaneous outpouring of respect and love. On the
morning of the day of burial the Kong Sverre came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
again, bringing the family and intimate friends to attend
the services here, which were held in the hall, and
were very impressive, especially so to us, for whom the
place has so many beautiful associations connected with
his life and music. After a prelude on the organ played
by his friend, Edward Grieg, there was prayer by the
pastor, and singing of a poem written for the service;
then followed an address, eloquent with feeling, by Mr.
Konow (the grandson of Öhlenschläger), a neighbor
and warm friend of Ole Bull. After music again, the
casket, covered deep with most beautiful flowers, the
gifts of friends, was borne by peasants down to the
steamer, followed by the family and friends, leaving desolate
the island which he had made a home, and so much
loved. The sad ride to Bergen was happily brightened
by the sun. The steamer, on entering the large fjord
which lies outside the harbor, was met by a convoy of
sixteen steamers, ranged on either side&#8212;a wonderfully
impressive escort. As the fleet approached the harbor
slowly, guns fired from the fort and answered by the
steamers echoed and reëchoed among the mountains.
The harbor and shipping were covered with flags of all
nations, at half&#8211;mast, the whole world paying its last
tribute to a genius which the whole world had learned
to know and love. The quay was covered thick with
green juniper, and festoons of green draped its whole
front to the water&#8217;s edge. Every shop and place of
business was shut; the whole population of the city
stood waiting silent, reverent. As the boat touched the
quay, and while the casket was being borne to the high
catafalque, one of the artist&#8217;s own melodies was played.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>Young girls, dressed in black, bore the trophies of his
foreign success; his gold crown and orders were carried
by distinguished men of Bergen. As the procession
passed slowly along the streets strewn with green, flowers
were showered on the coffin, and tears were seen
on many faces; but the silence was unbroken save by
the tones of Chopin&#8217;s funeral march, and the tolling of
the church bells. At the house where Ole Bull was
born, the procession halted while a verse of a poem
written by a friend was sung. At the grave, pastor
Wallum read the service, and spoke with feeling of the
work and life of the departed, and the gratitude of his
country.</p></div>

<p>Then Björnstjerne Björnson spoke to the assembled
thousands as follows:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Ole Bull was loved; this we see to&#8211;day; he was
honored, but it is more to be loved than to be honored!</p>

<p>If we would understand this deep attachment from
its inception, understand him, what he was, what he is
to us, then we must go far back to the time when he
first appeared among us.</p>

<p>We were a poor, a small nation, with glorious traditions
of earlier times, starting afresh with longings not
soon to be realized, longings for which we were sometimes
mocked.</p>

<p>Even of our own intellectual and spiritual inheritance
but few crumbs had fallen to us, Denmark having taken
the loaf. They said we were incapable of an independent
intellectual existence, and our best men believed
this. A Norse literature was deemed an impossibility,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
though the ample foundations were there to build upon;
an individual Norse school of history, a thing to be
laughed at; even our language was not acceptable unless
spoken with a Danish accent and soft consonants;
a national theatre not even to be thought of.</p>

<p>Our political situation was equally unfortunate. We
had been newly bought and sold, and what little liberty
we had presumed to seize, and had succeeded in extending,
gave us no security, but much concern.</p>

<p>We dared have no official celebrations, since it might
offend in high places. But a young generation came,
nourished on freedom, and without the fear and prudence
of their elders, but with more of defiance, more
of anger. They lived in the morning of freedom and
honor, and in this dawn came Ole Bull&#8217;s tones like the
first rays of the sun over the mountain tops.</p>

<p>At that time the folk&#8211;melodies invaded our music,
the democratic invaded the aristocratic, the national
the abstract, the individual the formulated ideal. To
our honor be it said, we followed.</p>

<p>Older men have told you of the giant form which suddenly
stood forth, not in the low, no, in the highest
places, before kings and the most cultured, and played
with a wild power, possessed by only one man before,
but in Ole Bull more original, more humanly sympathetic,&#8212;a
power for the first time Norse. When they
read how he stood and sang Norwegian melodies from
his violin to other nations, we felt that they were one
with us while they were moved to laughter and tears
as they caught glimpses back of him of our people and
grand, beautiful nature; thus one may understand the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
confidence, the faith, the pride he awakened,&#8212;he the
foremost of all in our Norse independence. Henrik
Wergeland expresses this when he makes Norway thus
sing to Ole Bull:&#8212;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Oh, world&#8211;wide is my son&#8217;s fair fame!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Anew my eye is proud aflame.</span><br />
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;On, on, my son! when thou art blest,</span><br />
<span class="i0">&#8217;Tis blessing in thy Mother&#8217;s breast.</span><br />
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;A poet I, for ages long;</span><br />
<span class="i0">The Norsemen&#8217;s legends are my song.</span><br />
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;My epic have I written too,</span><br />
<span class="i0">A noble thought each hero true.&#8221;</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>On his first return from his triumphs abroad it was a
festival but to look at him. When he played the folk&#8211;songs,
which had been timidly hidden, though cherished
in memory, now through him applauded by mighty rulers,
that generation felt themselves borne to the same
heights; Ole Bull became the first and greatest festival
in this people&#8217;s life; he gave us self&#8211;respect, the greatest
gift possible at that time.</p>

<p>This is Ole Bull&#8217;s undying honor, this the supreme
accomplishment of his life.</p>

<p>If one would measure the depth of an impression,
he must seek its expression in literature. Read Welhaven&#8217;s
poem at that time to Ole Bull. Any man with
a knowledge of European literature will not hesitate
to say that it is one of the most beautiful lyrics ever
written.</p>

<p>How happened it that he was the one to accomplish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
all this? His birth of a musical race had not sufficed
without the fervor of his patriotism. During our war
for independence he was still a boy at play, and his
childish voice was among the first to shout for our
young freedom. When a youth&#8212;I speak whereof I
know&#8212;his violin, with its boundless, exultant joy, sang
our first national songs in Henrik Wergeland&#8217;s college&#8211;room,
and became the overture to Wergeland&#8217;s inspiration
of our national observance of the 17th of May.
These feelings Ole Bull carried with him to other lands.</p>

<p>Patriotism was the creative power in his life. When
he established the Norse theatre, assisted Norse art,
helped the national museum, his mighty instrument
singing for other patriotic ends; when he helped his
countrymen and others wherever he found them, it was
not so much for the object, or the person, but for the
honor of Norway. He always felt himself our representative;
and, if he felt there was need, let it be at
home or abroad, that &#8220;Ole Olsen Viol, Norse Norman
from Norway&#8221;<a name="Anchor-25" id="Anchor-25"></a><a href="#Footnote-25" class="Anchor" title="Go to footnote 25.">[25]</a> should appear, he never failed us.</p>

<p>His patriotism had a certain tinge of <i>naïveté</i>, of morbidity,
about it; it was a consequence of the times. But
it was of importance to us that our finest gentleman,
coming from Europe&#8217;s most cultured salons, could and
would go arm in arm with our poor Norse beginnings.
It lies in the nature of things that first attempts are
never popular; they only become so when developed
and recognized by all; but, as a rule, they have then
outlived their usefulness.</p>

<p>It was this sturdy faithfulness in Ole Bull, spite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
his impulsive temperament, that made him dear to our
people; in other words, it was his patriotism.</p>

<p>So it was with Henrik Wergeland. Ole Bull and
Henrik Wergeland were of the same age and temperament.
The one responded to the other as in the
spring the wood&#8211;song answers the green of the meadows,
or on the western coast the sea skerries and irregular
mountain groups&#8212;the flickering sunshine on their
grassy slopes, their shifting lights and shadows&#8212;answer
the wooded ridges, the great, broad, rich landscape
of the east, with Mjosen&#8217;s gleaming surface in its midst.
The one was the blue boy of the west, with the ocean&#8217;s
salt flavor, the restless spirit of the Vikings; the other,
the gray boy of the east.<a name="Anchor-26" id="Anchor-26"></a><a href="#Footnote-26" class="Anchor" title="Go to footnote 26.">[26]</a> There was western blood in
Henrik Wergeland; but his genius had the color of
the mild, broad outlook of an eastern landscape, with
the mountains in the distance.</p>

<p>When Ole Bull talked of his art, he was wont to say
that he had learned to &#8220;sing&#8221; of the Italians. Without
doubt this was true; the outer form he had learned
from them, but the genius and the colors were from the
soul of our soul, the most spontaneous message of the
folk&#8211;song, as love of country made it glow in his consciousness.
An old, world&#8211;renowned artist<a name="Anchor-27" id="Anchor-27"></a><a href="#Footnote-27" class="Anchor" title="Go to footnote 27.">[27]</a> said to me:
&#8220;Faults in Ole Bull&#8217;s playing are more noticeable as he
advances in age; but no artist in our time has possessed
Ole Bull&#8217;s poetic power; no one has ever surpassed his
playing of the &#8216;Adagio.&#8217; I think all his cultivated auditors
will say the same.&#8221;</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>The criticism has been made that Ole Bull has failed
in not leaving behind him great musical works. This
is unjust. A man that could so fully give what he at
times gave us could not do more. In proportion to the
ability for the one, is the other impossible.</p>

<p>But it was important for us at that time, as it is always
important for a small nation, that we had a man
of the first rank among us. It was a direct connection
with the outside world. It exalted our aims. As far as
human power could, it spurred our ambition,&#8212;and that
in all directions. Let us then, at the grave of our greatest
citizen, say honor to him beyond all the artists who
have broken a way for us,&#8212;he who not alone inspired
followers in his profession, but also awakened ambition
and happiness wherever he was known; helping the
moral and intellectual forces,&#8212;the greatest legacy one
can bequeath.</p>

<p>I love to remember him on the great 17th of May
celebrations; for he was a celebration himself, majestic,
fascinating, as he walked among us. And a gesture of
his hand, a look, raised in him who received it a holiday
mood.</p>

<p>Thus hand in hand with all our national development,
ennobling it, cherishing in his love the least with the
greatest, always ennobling,&#8212;this was his life, this his
inspiration. Such a love of country rewards, as by
miracle, him who cherishes it. When I read every year
how he came home with summer, like the bird of passage,
how he came this summer, and that his love of
country, of home, bore him on, spite of distance, the
advice of physicians, and all hindrances, I thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
Henrik Wergeland&#8217;s words of Robert Major: &#8220;First
thence and then to heaven would the old gray republican.&#8221;
His eye would fondly rest on that land he loved
before it closed in death.</p>

<p>Countrymen! let us not leave this spot till we have
thanked her who did what a nation could not&#8212;opened
to his age a home of beauty and comfort....</p>

<p>Always before when we have spoken in Ole Bull&#8217;s
honor we have closed with a &#8220;Long live Ole Bull!&#8221;
This we may never say again&#8212;though dead to us he
is not,&#8212;he will be with us when we return to our
homes. Let my last words be an appeal to the young
here present. True to the dead one, as your elders
who knew him, ye cannot be; but by this grave, mark
the wonders worked by love of country, the miracle revealed
forever in this rich life of which we solemnize
the earthly close.</p></div>

<p>Again a hymn was sung, and Edward Grieg
then said with emotion:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Because more than any other thou wast the glory of
our land, because more than any other thou hast carried
our people with thee up towards the bright heights of
art, because thou wast more than any other a pioneer of
our young national music, more, much more, than any
other the faithful, warm&#8211;hearted conqueror of all hearts,
because thou hast planted a seed which shall spring up
in the future and for which coming generations shall
bless thee&#8212;with the gratitude of thousands upon
thousands, for all this, in the name of our Norse memorial
art, I lay this laurel wreath on thy coffin. Peace
be with thy ashes!</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Bendixen, on behalf of the National
Theatre, said:&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>With grateful remembrance that our great artist, ardently
loving his native land, saw with clear, penetrating
vision the influence of art on the development of
a people,&#8212;especially of an independent dramatic art
springing up in its midst,&#8212;with earnest and heartfelt
thanks, because we owe to his inspiring energy and example
the presence of that art in his own native city,
recognizing that his name will be always connected with
its history,&#8212;in the name of Bergen&#8217;s National Theatre,
I lay this wreath upon his grave.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;After the coffin had been put in the grave,
and the relatives had gone away, there was paid
a last tribute to Ole Bull,&#8212;a tribute more touching
and of more worth than the king&#8217;s message,
the gold crown, all the orders, and the flags of the
world at half&#8211;mast, meaning more love than the
pine&#8211;strewn streets of the silent city, and the tears
on its people&#8217;s faces; a tribute from poor peasants,
who had come in from the country far and
near, men who knew Ole Bull&#8217;s music by heart,&#8212;who,
in their lonely, poverty&#8211;stricken huts had
been proud of the man who had played their
&#8216;Gamle Norge&#8217; before the kings of the earth.
These men were there by hundreds, each bringing
a green bough, or a fern, or a flower; they
waited humbly till all others had left the grave,
then crowded up, and threw in, each man, the
only token he had been rich enough to bring.
The grave was filled to the brim. And it is not
irreverent to say, that to Ole Bull, in heaven,
there could come no gladder memory of earth
than that the last honors paid him there were
wild leaves and flowers of Norway, laid on his
body by the loving hands of Norway peasants.&#8221;</p>

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>

<h3>THE ANATOMY OF THE VIOLINIST, MR. OLE
BULL: HIS POSE AND METHOD OF HOLDING
THE VIOLIN.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By A. B. CROSBY, A. M., M. D.</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Professor of Anatomy, Bellevue Hospital Medical College, New York</i>, 1877.</p>


<p>Thirty&#8211;one years ago, in a quaint old Congregational
church in a New England village, I first heard Mr. Ole
Bull perform on the violin, and witnessed</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;The matchless skill, the potent art that brings</span><br />
<span class="i0">Voices of earth, or heaven, from those mute strings.&#8221;</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>I had never seen a violin save in the hands of a country
dancing&#8211;master, and it was like a new revelation
when this high&#8211;bred gentleman stood up &#8220;every inch a
man,&#8221; and with &#8220;charmed touch&#8221; dignified his instrument.</p>

<p>During the past few weeks, both in public and private,
I have had an opportunity to enjoy again the magic of
the weird musician&#8217;s art, and I find that the boyish pleasure
stands the test of manhood&#8217;s reflection. But in my
later experience I have not only drank in my fill of the
&#8220;dulcet creams&#8221; of music, but from the stand&#8211;point of
an anatomist have attempted to unravel the secret of
Mr. Bull&#8217;s graceful pose and unique method of holding
the violin. Nor has my study been without results,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
which I shall attempt to develop for the benefit of the
ambitious violinist who would adopt the methods of a
master.</p>

<p>The pose of Mr. Bull when playing is a model of
manly grace. He rests his body centrally over the
left leg as a firm column of support, while the right
foot is advanced and the right leg forms an oblique
brace. The pose is essentially the &#8220;rest&#8221; of the soldier,
and combines the maximum of ease and stability.</p>

<p>The figure is singularly erect, nor does the head incline
like that of the ordinary violinist&#8212;save only in
certain inspired moments when for an instant the ear
drops towards the well loved instrument as if to catch</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">
&#8220;The still sad music of humanity&#8221;</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>inaudible to other ears. Both the head and chin are
absolutely free and seem to feel no responsibility for
the position of the violin. The bust, which has been
superbly developed by a lifetime of musical gymnastics,
measures on full inspiration forty&#8211;two inches, having
an expansion of three inches. The waist, at twenty&#8211;four
years of age, measured twenty&#8211;four inches; and
although the years have increased, the waist measure
remains exactly the same. Mr. Bull&#8217;s height in his
stocking&#8211;feet is five feet eleven and a quarter inches.
As he stands before an audience waiting for his accompaniment,
with his small waist, his superb bust, his
finely cut face, and the carriage of a prince, he is the
incarnation of the Magnus Apollo. But when his imperial
bow grows liquid and pours out silvery notes like
the music of many waters, we seem to see as in a dream
that the wheel of Ixion stops, the stone of Sisyphus
stands still, Tantalus forgets his perpetual thirst, and
even the Furies relent. Then it is that we wake to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
find that Apollo, as in the ancient myth, has yielded
the lyre to Orpheus.</p>

<p>The excellence of Mr. Bull&#8217;s method in holding the
violin depends mainly on the admirable position of the
left arm. The upper arm is carried forward and inward,
the elbow being brought well in front of the
chest. The fore&#8211;arm is then flexed, thus forming a
brace to support the neck of the instrument, while the
same portion of the arm is in a position of extreme
supination; that is, the fore&#8211;arm is turned so that the
palm is upward. It will thus be observed that the palm
of the hand is placed higher than the clavicle or collar&#8211;bone,
where the tail&#8211;piece of the violin rests (Fig. 1).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
When the violin is placed in position, the tail&#8211;piece rests
against the root of the neck, just above the clavicle or
collar&#8211;bone, while the neck of the instrument reposes
upon the palmar surface of the thumb throughout the
whole or part of its extent, according to the exigencies
of the fingering.</p>



<div class="figcenter" style="width: 404px;">
<a id="figt331"></a>
<a href="images/figt331h.jpg" >
<img src="images/figt331.jpg" width="404" height="500" alt="" />
</a>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span></p>
</div>

<p>It will thus be seen that from the palm to the root of
the neck the violin rests upon an inclined plane, gravitating
towards the collar&#8211;bone (see Fig. 1). The instrument
then is not <i>held</i>, but <i>rests</i> upon a friendly hand
and neck.</p>

<p>From the fact that its position is maintained by the
force of gravity, it follows that the chin need not grasp
the base of the violin&#8212;since it holds itself&#8212;and the
head is left free and erect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the old&#8211;time violinist&#8217;s constrained head position
is avoided.</p>

<p>The line of support along the palmar surface of the
thumb is full of anatomical interest.</p>

<p>The accompanying diagram (Fig. 2) may serve to illustrate
this and some other points. A black line will
be seen extending along the whole length of the palmar
surface of the thumb, crossing the base of the annular
ligament to a point a little above the wrist. This is
essentially the line of support for the neck and upper
curves of the violin. It may be called a movable rest,
swaying laterally, it is true, but only to a limited extent.
The thumb is placed on a different plane from the rest
of the fingers, and has motions essentially different
from them. The power of perfect opposition to all the
fingers by the thumb distinguishes man from the most
intelligent of the lower animals.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 398px;">
<a id="figt332"></a>
<a href="images/figt332h.jpg" >
<img src="images/figt332.jpg" width="398" height="501" alt="" />
</a>
<p class="caption"><i>PALMAR SURFACE OF LEFT HAND. After Gray.</i><br /><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Although the thumb possesses a cunning in movements
far superior to the other fingers, yet in Mr. Bull&#8217;s
method the thumb, at any given instant, is the fixed
point or rest for the upper part of the violin, while the
fingers are left absolutely free and movable for the demands
of fingering.</p>

<p>Referring again to Fig. 2, it will be seen that the
muscles of the thumb, consisting of the Opponens Pollicis,
Abductor Pollicis, Flexor Brevis Pollicis, Flexor
Longus Pollicis, and Adductor Pollicis, are connected
absolutely with the thumb, and in Mr. Bull&#8217;s method
they move it only sufficiently to constitute a movable
rest.</p>

<p>The annular ligament consists of a dense, firm, white,
fibrous band, attached to bony prominences on either
side of the wrist, thus forming a strong membranous
arch, which is capable of supporting the violin without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
difficulty, while beneath and protected by it the long
flexor tendons glide uninterruptedly, thus permitting absolutely
free flexion of the fingers on the finger&#8211;board.
Mr. Bull never grasps the neck of the instrument between
the thumb and fingers, since this would at once
put such constraint on the fingers as to prevent rapid
and effective action on the finger&#8211;board.</p>

<p>In fine, the violin <i>rests</i> without restraint, like an obedient
slave, on a couch formed for it by the arm of its
imperial master.</p>

<p>Nothing is more observable in Mr. Bull&#8217;s method
than the peculiar obliquity of the finger&#8211;tips when applied
to the strings. Some have claimed that the tips
of the fingers when applied to the strings should be essentially
at right angles to the finger&#8211;board. Mr. Bull
discovered experimentally that such a method of fingering
increased his nervous exhaustion, and gave him
positive brain&#8211;fatigue, frequently after only moderate
practice.</p>

<p>He therefore learned instinctively to give the fingers
the pose seen in Fig. 1, which he claims diminishes
perceptibly nervous exhaustion, at the same time that it
insures to the fingers much greater freedom of flexion.
By consulting the cut it will be observed that the finger&#8211;tips
approach the finger&#8211;board with a marked obliquity,
and that the points of pressure are not on the tips of
the pulps of the fingers, but on their radial or thumb
side near the angle of the nails. If we examine the end
of the finger we shall observe a series of curved lines or
ridges, which are made up of &#8220;<span lang="la">papillæ tactûs</span>,&#8221; or points
of touch, having a linear arrangement and acute sensibility.
These ridges are broader and better developed
over the tips of the pulps of the fingers than on the
sides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>It follows that the sensibility, most acute at the tips,
gradually diminishes as we approach the sides. Moreover
the epidermis, or scarf&#8211;skin, gradually increases in
thickness as we approach the angle of the nails; hence
the &#8220;point of election&#8221; with Mr. Bull in making pressure
on the strings is best adapted for the purpose,
since the points of touch are less sensitive, and their
sensibility is still farther diminished by an increased
thickness of the epidermic covering. In this matter,
then, it would seem that Mr. Bull has anatomical &#8220;justification&#8221;
for the faith that is in him.</p>

<p>I was anxious to determine as far as possible the
points of contact between the &#8220;line of support&#8221; on the
thumb and the violin, when the fingers were at different
points on the finger&#8211;board. It was a matter of no little
difficulty, since, as before observed, the thumb while
playing constitutes a movable rest, and glides with infinite
ease and grace from the head to the body of the
instrument. Nor could the distinguished gentleman
himself afford me much assistance. The habit of a lifetime
had become a second nature; it could be done
easily and gracefully, but it was difficult to do it and
analyze it at the same time. Nay more, the very attempt
threatened to throw us into confusion worse confounded.
The problem was at length solved in this
wise. Standing behind the musician, I requested him
to entirely ignore me and my object, and to play some
of his most impassioned pieces, &#8220;the world forgetting
and by the world forgot.&#8221; Dividing the finger&#8211;board
into four equal segments, I watched the play of the left
hand up and down the violin, and noted the positions
assumed by the thumb at different points.</p>

<p>By noting the points of contact and support when the
index and middle fingers pressed the strings at the upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
part of each fourth, I was enabled to establish four
definite positions. It should be noted that this division
of the finger&#8211;board into fourths is not musical but purely
arbitrary, in order to establish the pose of the violin on
the thumb when the hand is at different points along
the instrument. Thus we might hope to get an approximate
idea of the way in which the one position easily
glides into the next. The accompanying cuts may
serve to illustrate the four positions. Fig. 1, already
several times referred to, shows the first position. The
index and middle fingers press the string at the lower
part of the first fourth of the finger&#8211;board. The neck of
the instrument rests along the whole length of the palmar
line on the thumb, as represented in Fig. 2. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
curve at the upper part of the body of the violin marked
A (Fig. 1) is seen to rest against the wrist. This is
rarely the case when Mr. Bull is playing; but it became
necessary as a rest during the horrors of photographing.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 425px;">

</a>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span></p>
</div>

<p>It is perhaps unnecessary to again call attention to
the fact that the violin rests on an inclined plane, its
position being almost entirely maintained by its own
gravity.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 433px;">

</a>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Fig. 3 shows the second position. It will be seen
that the pose of the arm is essentially the same, but the
thumb has glided up the neck of the violin until the
index finger rests at the lower extremity of the second
fourth of the finger&#8211;board. The neck of the instrument
rests on the anterior extremity of the thumb line,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
while the curve marked B (Fig. 3) rests upon the annular
ligament (for which see Fig. 2). Fig. 4 simply
shows the reverse of the position shown in Fig. 3.
Fig. 5 represents the third position. The index finger
rests at the beginning of the third fourth of the finger&#8211;board.
The anterior extremity of the thumb line
supports the base of the neck adjoining the &#8220;shield,&#8221;
while the curve marked C rests against the base of the
thumb and annular ligament.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 346px;">

</a>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Fig. 6 shows the fourth position. The index finger
here rests at the commencement of the last fourth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
the finger&#8211;board. The anterior extremity of the thumb
line presses against the base of the neck adjoining the
&#8220;shield.&#8221; When Mr. Clay reached the highest flights
of his eloquence, one of his admirers in the Senate
said that he looked &#8220;forty feet high.&#8221; Mr. Bull, who
has been thought to resemble the great statesman in
personal appearance, makes somewhat the same impression
on the spectator when he reaches his highest
notes. Involving, as these notes do, fingering in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
highest fourth of the board, it becomes necessary for
the musician to elevate the whole instrument, since it
is simply steadied against the neck by the thumb, as
may be seen in the cut; and by the time the highest
note is reached, the grand proportions of the Viking
have towered to their utmost height. To one who has
seen Mr. Bull at such a time this will not, I am sure,
seem an exaggeration.</p>

<p>It is a well known fact that playing on the violin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
develops the muscles of the arms and chest to a most
remarkable extent. It is a matter of some interest to
inquire what effect, in the case of Mr. Bull, a lifelong
practice on the instrument has had. I append the sub&#8211;joined
measurements which I took from this gentleman.</p>

<p>The chest measure over nipples was forty&#8211;two inches
on full inspiration. On forced expiration the measurement
was thirty&#8211;nine inches. The measurement from
the middle of the top of breast&#8211;bone to tip of shoulder
was the same on both sides, namely, ten inches. It is
well known that there is a normal difference between
the right and left sides of the body.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&#8212;As Dr. Crosby&#8217;s paper is unfinished, we append
to it a letter from the celebrated Tartini, which was translated
and published by Dr. Burney in 1779, as &#8220;an important
lesson to performers on the violin.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Ole Bull was once speaking of his experiences in
Italy, in 1834, he said: &#8220;I tried, if possible, to hear some
player of the old Italian school. I happened to come in
contact with an old man of ninety years, a pupil&#8212;amateur
pupil, I will add&#8212;of Tartini. I paid him my respects, and
asked to see his violin and hear him play, as it was my intention
to study the Italian method. With infinite grace he
took up an old Amati violin, the sight of which made my eyes
water, and putting the bow on the strings, he produced tones
which were an exact reproduction of the Tartini method as
published by that great master in a letter which was shown
me. Ah! so different from the modern school! Why, the
violinist of to&#8211;day serves his instrument as though it were a
slave, and must be driven to duty with the lash. The player
should treat his violin as a tender child&#8212;fondle and caress
it, not beat it. The beauty of a performance lies in exacting
from the instrument tones corresponding with the deep love
a true artist feels for his art.&#8221;</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>The letter referred to by Ole Bull was the one translated
by Dr. Burney, which reads as follows:&#8212;</p>

<p class="letterhead">
<span class="smcap">Padua</span>, <i>March 5, 1760</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My very much Esteemed Signora Maddalena</span>,&#8212;Finding
myself at length disengaged from the weighty business
which has so long prevented me from performing my promise
to you, a promise which was made with too much sincerity for
my want of punctuality not to afflict me, I shall begin the instructions
you wish from me by letter; and if I should not
explain myself with sufficient clearness, I entreat you to tell
me your doubts and difficulties in writing, which I shall not
fail to remove in a future letter.</p>

<p>Your principal practice and study should, at present, be
confined to the use and power of the bow, in order to make
yourself entirely mistress in the execution and expression of
whatever can be played or sung, within the compass and ability
of your instrument. Your first study, therefore, should be
the true manner of holding, balancing, and pressing the bow
lightly, but steadily, upon the strings; in such a manner as it
shall seem to breathe the first tone it gives, which must proceed
from the friction of the string, and not from percussion,
as by a blow given with a hammer upon it. This depends on
laying the bow lightly upon the strings at the first contact,
and on gently pressing it afterwards, which, if done gradually,
can scarcely have too much force given to it, because, if the
tone is begun with delicacy, there is little danger of rendering
it afterwards either coarse or harsh.</p>

<p>Of this first contact and delicate manner of beginning a
tone you should make yourself a perfect mistress in every
situation and part of the bow, as well in the middle as at the
extremities; and in moving it up as well as in drawing it
down. To unite all these laborious particulars into one lesson,
my advice is, that you first exercise yourself in a swell
upon an open string, for example, upon the second string;
that you begin <i>pianissimo</i>, and increase the tone by slow degrees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
to its <i>fortissimo</i>; and this study should be equally made
with the motion of the bow up and down, in which exercise
you should spend at least an hour every day, though at different
times, a little in the morning and a little in the evening;
having constantly in mind that this is, of all things, the most
difficult and the most essential to playing well on the violin.
When you are a perfect mistress of this part of a good performer,
a swell will be very easy to you; beginning with the
most minute softness, increasing the tone to its loudest degree,
and diminishing it to the same point of softness with
which you began, and all this in the same stroke of the bow.
Every degree of pressure upon the string which the expression
of a note or passage shall require will by this means be
easy and certain; and you will be able to execute with your
bow whatever you please. After this, in order to acquire
that light pulsation and play of the wrist, from whence velocity
in bowing arises, it will be best for you to practice every
day one of the <i>Allegros</i>, of which there are three in Corelli&#8217;s
solos, which entirely move in semiquavers. The first is in
D, in playing which you should accelerate the motion a little
each time, till you arrive at the quickest degree of swiftness
possible; but two precautions are necessary in this exercise:
the first is, that you play the notes <i>staccato</i>, that is, separate
and detached, with a little space between every two, for
though they are written thus&#8212;</p>

<p>they should be played as if there was a rest after every note,
in this manner&#8212;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img class="plain" src="images/figt343b.png" width="300" height="62" alt="" />
<p class="caption">etc.</p>
</div>

<p>The second precaution is, that you first play with the point
of the bow; and when that becomes easy to you, that you use
that part of it which is between the point and the middle;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
and when you are likewise mistress of this part of the bow,
that you practice in the same manner with the middle of the
bow; and above all, you must remember in these studies to
begin the <i>Allegros</i> or flights sometimes with an up&#8211;bow, and
sometimes with a down&#8211;bow, carefully avoiding the habit of
constantly practicing one way. In order to acquire a greater
facility of executing swift passages in a light and neat manner,
it will be of great use to you if you accustom yourself to
skip over a string between two quick notes in divisions, like
these&#8212;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img class="plain" src="images/figt344.png" width="400" height="151" alt="" />
<p class="caption">etc.</p>
</div>

<p>Of such divisions you may play extempore as many as possible,
and in every key, which will be both useful and necessary.</p>

<p>With regard to the finger&#8211;board, or carriage of the left
hand, I have one thing strongly to recommend to you, which
will suffice for all; and that is, the taking a violin part, either
the first or second of a concerto, sonata, or song, anything
will serve the purpose, and playing it upon the half&#8211;shift, that
is, with the first finger upon G on the first string, and constantly
keeping upon this shift, playing the whole piece without
moving the hand from this situation, unless A on the
fourth string be wanted, or D upon the first; but in that case,
you should afterwards return again to the half&#8211;shift, without
ever moving the hand down to the natural position. This
practice should be continued till you can execute with facility
upon the half&#8211;shift any violin part not intended as a solo,
at sight. After this advance the hand on the finger&#8211;board to
the whole&#8211;shift, with the first finger upon A on the first string,
and accustom yourself to this position till you can execute
everything upon the whole&#8211;shift with as much ease as when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
the hand is in its natural situation; and when certain of this,
advance to the double&#8211;shift, with the first finger upon B, on
the first string; and when sure of that likewise, pass to the
fourth position of the hand, making C with the first finger
upon the first string; and indeed this is a scale in which,
when you are firm, you may be said to be mistress of the finger&#8211;board.
This study is so necessary, that I most earnestly
recommend it to your attention.</p>

<p>I now pass to the third essential part of a good performer
on the violin, which is the making of a good shake, and I
would have you practice it slow, moderately fast, and quick,
that is, with the two notes succeeding each other in these
three degrees of <i>adagio</i>, <i>andante</i>, and <i>presto</i>; and in practice
you have great occasion for these different kinds of shakes,
for the same shake will not serve with equal propriety for a
slow movement as for a quick one; but to acquire both at
once with the same trouble, begin with an open string, either
the first or second, it will be equally useful; sustain the note
in a swell, and begin the shake very slow, increasing in quickness,
by insensible degrees, till it becomes rapid, in the manner
following:&#8212;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img class="plain" src="images/figt345.png" width="400" height="197" alt="" />
</div>

<p>But you must not vigorously move immediately from semiquavers
to demi&#8211;semiquavers, as in this example, or from these
to the next in degree&#8212;that would be doubling the velocity of
the shake all at once, which would be a skip, not a graduation;
but you can imagine between a semiquaver and a demi&#8211;semiquaver
intermediate degrees of rapidity, quicker than the
one, and slower than the other of these characters; you are
therefore to increase in velocity by the same degrees in practicing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
the shake, as in loudness when you make a swell. You
must attentively and assiduously persevere in the practice of
this embellishment, and begin at first with an open string,
upon which if you are once able to make a good shake with
the first finger, you will with the greater facility acquire one
with the second, the third, and the fourth, or little finger, with
which you must practice in a particular manner, as more feeble
than the rest of its brethren. I shall, at present, propose
no other studies to your application; what I have already
said is more than sufficient, if your zeal is equal to my
wishes, for your improvement. I hope you will sincerely inform
me whether I have explained myself clearly thus far;
that you will accept of my respects, which I likewise beg of
you to present to the Prioress, to Signora Teresa, and to Signora
Chiara, for all whom I have a sincere regard; and believe
me to be, with great affection,</p>

<h3>VIOLIN NOTES.</h3>

<p class="center">BY OLE BULL.</p>


<h4>PREFACE.</h4>

<p>Ole Bull had long contemplated revising and filling out
his fragmentary notes on the violin and its construction, jotted
down at various times. Excepting some slight rearrangement
they are now presented as he left them, unfinished and
incomplete. As they stand they are genuine and characteristic,
and doubtless indicate part of the general design he was
not permitted to complete.</p>

<p>Aided by peculiar physical and nervous force Ole Bull presented
that rare combination,&#8212;excellence in the <i>technique</i> of
the left hand, with equal excellence in that of the bow. No
difficulty in the fingering of double, treble, and quadruple
tones seemed to exist for him. The fact that the violin is
not best calculated for the powerful demands of a four&#8211;part
passage, and that, therefore, the effect in a large hall is apt
to be hazy and indistinct, should in no way detract from the
wonderful skill required for its performance. In executing a
trill he showed no partiality for a particular finger: the pulsation
was always even and clear. His scales were extremely
smooth, both in ascending and descending. He excelled in
executing whole passages in any fixed position, also in rapid
shifting from a low position to a high one and <i>vice versâ</i>, and
in pizzicato with the left hand. In the management of the
bow he was unrivaled. His staccato was peculiar to himself,
and was simply perfection. Whether the bow was impelled
in a succession of little rippling bounds or of detached <i>martelé</i>
strokes, each note possessed wonderful distinctness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
impetus. In the arpeggio the notes were never slurred together,
and the double accentuation of the lowest and highest
notes imparted a full rhythmic swing to such passages.
The tremolo and <i>sautillé</i> displayed the delicate flexibility of
his wrist. His tone was pure, elastic, and sympathetic.</p>

<p>In his compositions the various motives are always well
worked out, and abound in broad and beautiful effects. As
they were written for himself, they exemplify his peculiarities
of fingering and bowing. Like Paganini&#8217;s, they are almost
unplayable; for, apart from the difficulties of <i>technique</i>, without
the <i>vis viva</i> of the master they lack their greatest charm.</p>

<p>To his remarkable personal magnetism was added a grace
and dignity of appearance, an unvarying amiability and courtesy
of manner. He met few whose feelings towards him,
however antagonistic at first, did not speedily become warm
and friendly, and little children loved him.</p>

<h4>THE ORIGIN OF THE VIOLIN.</h4>

<p>The country which affords us the most ancient memorials
of a perfect language, of an advanced civilization,
of a philosophy in which all phases of human
thought find expression, of a poetry rich in every style,
and of a musical art corresponding with the lively susceptibilities
of the people&#8212;India&#8212;appears to have
given birth to bow instruments.</p>

<p>Classical antiquity, in its forms of sculpture and bas&#8211;relief,
contains no suggestion of the instrument. A little
figure of Apollo playing upon a kind of violin with
something like a bow, exhibited in Florence, has been
proved to be of modern production. This is the only
known piece of sculpture reputed ancient, in which anything
like a bow can be found. Ancient painting, while
giving many delineations of musical instruments, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
every case fails to represent that indispensable adjunct
of the violin proper,&#8212;the bow.</p>

<p>As to India, no conjecture based on obscure interpretation
of record or delineation is needed, for the veritable
instruments exist to&#8211;day, preserving, in the main,
their original characteristics. The first or simplest form
of bow instrument seems to have consisted of a little
hollow cylinder of wood covered at one end with a
piece of skin tightly stretched, and furnished with a
neck and bridge, the whole being very much like a
modern banjo. A slip of bamboo, bent so as to hold
tense a bundle of hairs, furnished the bow. The number
of strings was variable, according to the purpose of
the instrument. Thus, in the case of the virtuoso, one
string was deemed sufficient, while for the uses of the
common people two or three were permitted. The antiquity
claimed by Indian writers for this form of bow
instrument is almost incredible; one tradition relates
that it was invented by one of the early kings of Ceylon,
at a period about five thousand years before the
Christian era. In that dawn of history the migratory
tides flowing from the East to the West, from India
through Asia, Persia, Arabia, thence through northern
Europe, and thence across the Danube and the Rhine,
have left other memorials than the stormy history of
their wars. The polite arts of to&#8211;day find their crude
germs in that ancient time. And although, by the
ready interchange of ideas achieved by modern civilization,
a modern invention may embody suggestions gathered
from all countries and all times, it is possible to
examine each component part, to follow up each relative
train of thought which has here found practical expression,
until we arrive at the single idea, the main&#8211;spring,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
as it were, of the whole mechanism. In music the violin
may be traced back through a thousand varied forms
until it finds its beginning in the <i>revanastron</i>, or, as I
have called it, the banjo&#8211;fiddle of India. At the time of
its invention, it was undoubtedly designed for nothing
higher than an accompaniment to the voice. As such
it exists to&#8211;day in parts of India and Arabia, and in
such menial capacity it was retained until about the
12th century. In fact, bow instruments did not come
into special notice in Europe until about the 13th or
14th century.</p>

<p>At that time the natural divisions of the human
voice, long recognized, were definitely classed into soprano,
tenor, alto, and bass; and music began to be
considered in the true dignity of its position as an art
to be scientifically cultivated. With the scientific division
of the voice, bow instruments became at once
similarly divided into their four registers. The form of
instruments was still arbitrary; the number of strings
and manner of tuning varied with every new caprice;
but the instrumental combinations of that day contained
the nucleus of the modern quartette.</p>

<p>Still, despite the progressive steps and more popular
diffusion of musical knowledge, the instruments of the
violin family at that time, and for a period of nearly two
centuries, held but a precarious tenure of existence in
the rivalry with the more robust fellow&#8211;members of the
orchestra; for the musical susceptibilities of the people
appear to have been more cordially appealed to and
drawn out by the sonorous blasts of the brazen trumpet
and the artillery of the kettle&#8211;drum, than by the sweet
and subdued tones of the bow instruments of the day.</p>

<p>It is related that King Henry the Eighth of England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
in the year 1530, was entertained at Cardinal Wolsey&#8217;s
palace with &#8220;a concert of drums and fifes.&#8221; This is
nothing compared with the heroic endurance of his
daughter Elizabeth, who was &#8220;daily regaled during dinner
with twelve trumpets, two kettle&#8211;drums, which, together
with fifes, cornets, and side&#8211;drums, made the hall
ring for half an hour together.&#8221;</p>

<p>Between the latter part of the 15th century and the
first half of the 16th, the instruments of the viol family,
with the introduction of the <i>viol d&#8217;amour</i> and the <i>viol di
gamba</i>, reached the terminus of their servitude as appendages
to the voice, and at one step culminated in
the invention of the violin as we have it to&#8211;day. The
new curvatures of the top and back; the deep indentures
of the sides for convenience of the bow; the sweep
of the outline; the scroll; the removal of the frets on
the finger&#8211;board,&#8212;an ancient distinguishing feature,
perpetuated in the arrangement of the neck of the guitar,&#8212;all
these innovations upon established conventionality
seem to have been made at once. Since that
time the violin has steadily, and without retrogression,
advanced to its present position in popular estimation,&#8212;the
aristocrat of musical instruments. Laboring under
difficulties not encountered by the voice, it is yet
capable of presenting a rhythmic musical picture, which
the mind can take up and at once translate to the feelings
in intelligible language.</p>


<h4>GASPAR DA SALO AND THE CREMONA SCHOOL.</h4>

<p>The form of the violin varied with the epoch in
which it was used. The lifetime of Tartini (born <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span>
1692, died <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 1770) marks the period during which
the powers of the violin in all varieties and styles were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
completely developed. The violin&#8211;makers had to adapt
their instruments to the wants of the performers. The
efforts of Stradivarius and Guarnerius contributed in
a marked degree to assist Tartini in creating a new
era for the violin. The best epoch of Stradivarius was
from 1700 to 1720 or 1725. It was during Tartini&#8217;s
lifetime that considerable rise in the pitch took place.
This, in the violin, necessitated a new arrangement to
withstand the greater strain. The instrument kept
pace with the new demands made upon it. In consequence
of the increased powers of the general orchestra,
the old delicate sweetness of the Amatis ceased to
be the chief desideratum, a more masculine and heroic
tone gaining the preference. This quality of tone
reached its climax in Joseph Guarnerius.</p>

<p>When Francis I. was in Rome and heard the choir
of the Vatican Chapel, he was so charmed with the violin,
that he induced the lutier Gaspar Duiffoprugcar,
also, as I believe, called Da Salo<a name="Anchor-28" id="Anchor-28"></a><a href="#Footnote-28" class="Anchor" title="Go to footnote 28.">[28]</a> after his native town
on Lake Garda, to accompany him to Paris, there to
make violins, violas, and contrabasses for his court. It
is known of Gaspar&#8217;s history that he was quite unable
to endure the climate of Paris, and therefore removed
to Lyons; so that his instruments date from three
places,&#8212;Brescia, Paris, and Lyons.</p>

<p>His instruments, at least those made during his life
in Italy, are for the most part roughly constructed. His
varnish is of a brownish yellow color, exceedingly fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
and soft. The thickness of wood in the top and back
is so adjusted as to give to the tone quality, power, and
solidity, and great variety of color. Da Salo violins of
any of his periods are very rare.</p>

<p>The viol in Raphael&#8217;s &#8220;Parnassus,&#8221; where Apollo is
represented as playing it, was introduced in honor of
the then admired <i>improvisatore</i> and violist Giacomo
Sansecondo, who had inspired in Raphael so great an
admiration for the viol that he considered it worthy of
being placed in the hands of the god of song. In
Giacomo Sansecondo&#8217;s time the violin had been already
introduced, and he was doubtless able to play that instrument.
As Gaspar da Salo was then living, it is
probable that the viol in the picture was drawn from a
model supplied by him. In the first changes from the
form of the viol to that of the violin, the new offshoot
retained many of the peculiarities of its older kindred,
notably in the broad, full oval of the back and top, and
the pointed <i>f</i> holes.</p>

<p>The violins of Gaspar da Salo and Joseph Guarnerius
have the sound of a trumpet, horn, or flute; those of
Stradivarius have the sound of the oboe and clarinet;
and those of the Amati family, of the English horn and
the human voice. The Steiner violins have the greatest
diversity of color between the upper and lower strings,
and resemble a sharp oboe. The violins of Maggini are
grand but somewhat hollow in tone, inclining to the
viola; this quality is due to their curves and large proportions.</p>

<p>Andrew Amati, the earliest of the Cremonese makers,
is supposed to have learned the principles of his art in
the Brescian school. He made violins for the courts of
France, Italy, and Spain; and these instruments were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
often ornamented by gilding or painting&#8212;covered with
devices in gold, Latin adages, and in some instances the
coats of arms of the different courts for which they were
made. His violins are all of high model. His workmanship
in all the details of outline, swells, <i>f</i> holes,
scroll, etc. is exceedingly fine. They have enough
wood at the centre of the top and back, but are rather
thin at the extremities. The tone is sweet and vocal,
but sometimes inferior on the G and D strings. He
discarded the serious cathedral style of Da Salo and
Maggini, together with the broad, thick, and strong extremities
of their instruments; and it must be said that
his narrow, hollow, rounded, thin violins were admirably
adapted to their purpose; the sweet and subdued tone
harmonizing with that of the <i>viol d&#8217;amour</i> and its kindred
in the interpretation of the ballad music of the
royal chambers.</p>

<p>Antonius and Hieronymus Amati, the two sons of
Andrew, at first worked together in the style of their
father, but later they adopted a model somewhat flatter
at the edges. These violins combine great beauty of
form with superior wood, and have a fine and brilliant
though delicate tone. After some years the brothers
ceased working together.</p>

<p>I have seen several violins of Antonius Amati. They
were all of rather high model. The wood of the back
and sides was frequently of pear&#8211;tree, but they were
made quite strong in wood, and therefore possessed a
rather strong tone, particularly on the G string.</p>

<p>The violins of Hieronymus Amati are of larger pattern
and flatter model than those of his brother, but are
not so finely finished. Their tone, however, is much
finer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>Nicholas Amati, son of Hieronymus, was the most
celebrated maker of the family. In his large instruments
he flattened the model somewhat, carving it
sometimes, however, rather abruptly to a ridge in the
centre, and making the curve an inch from the edges
all around slightly concave. His workmanship was
always most careful, and his finish exquisite. In these
respects, he has never been excelled by any of the
Italian makers. The tone, while often sufficiently powerful,
lacks the breadth of the Gaspar da Salo, or Joseph
Guarnerius. The varnish is generally yellow, and
somewhat thin in body. Of all the Amati family, Andrew
had the best varnish, it being more intense and
rich in color and having greater body than that used
by his sons.</p>

<p>Antonius Stradivarius was a pupil of the Amatis. His
life has been divided into three periods,&#8212;his pupilage,
his emancipation from the old rules, or artistic period,
and his old age. He made a great many violins. He
originated a new outline, flattened the model, did away
with the excessive gutter or hollowing out at the edges,
and selected his wood with regard to beauty as well
as quality. His violins of the second period are marvels
of neat, attentive workmanship. The varnish has
a beautiful warmth of color, and great flexibility. But
although the tone is wonderfully even and full, it is
tinctured with a peculiar nasal quality. For this reason,
though I have owned several fine specimens of this
maker, among them one of a quartette made for the
court of Spain, I have never played on them in public.</p>

<p>Of the Guarnerius family, I shall only mention
Joseph, the nephew of Andrew. Rejecting the new
form of Stradivarius and the older traditions of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
Amatis, he seems to have chosen Gaspar da Salo and
Maggini for his models; but his violins, while combining
the peculiarities of these two makers, preserve the
stamp of his own genius. The salient points of the
Brescian school are noticed in the pointed <i>f</i> holes, the
sweep of the outline, and the curve of the back. His
violins are generally flat in model. The workmanship
in its minute details is not always careful. The purfling
is irregular, the edges not well finished, the outline
awry, the <i>f</i> holes irregular, and the scrolls show
the marks of the chisel; but all is thoroughly characteristic.
The varnish is of every color,&#8212;yellow, red,
and brown, and generally of fine intensity of color and
great body. The tone, like that of Da Salo, is full and
masculine. Those instruments which were produced
during one not very long period of his life are by far
his best; those made at other times are inferior, and in
some cases almost unrecognizable as his productions.
Possessing more genius than Stradivarius, he wasted
his abilities, and rumor asserts that he led a life of idleness
and dissipation, broken only, under pressure of
want, by fitful periods of industry.</p>


<h4>MY CONCERT GASPAR DA SALO.<a name="Anchor-29" id="Anchor-29"></a><a href="#Footnote-29" class="Anchor" title="Go to footnote 29.">[29]</a></h4>

<p>Once after a rehearsal in Breslau, in the year 1862,
an old amateur and esteemed friend, Amtmann Zoller,
who had purchased a collection of violins, wished me
to look at them. I went, in company with a violin&#8211;maker,
and saw the collection. The instruments were
very fine, but I said, &#8220;The pearl of all is this Gaspar
da Salo.&#8221; The Amtmann answered, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>&#8220;I think so myself,
and I am much pleased to find you agree with me. But
the connoisseurs here are unwilling to see any special
merit in the instrument, and if it should be sold I do
not think it would bring so much as some of the
others.&#8221; When we left his house,&#8212;we had breakfasted
with him,&#8212;the violin&#8211;maker said, &#8220;Why did you praise
that violin so highly? You surely did not think that a
superior instrument?&#8221; He then asked me why I did
not offer to buy it. I said I could not think of offending
the Amtmann by offering to purchase, for I did not
suppose the violin was for sale. I consented, however,
that he should ask him. The following morning he
came to me, saying he had been to the Amtmann, who
wished to see me. At our interview, in answer to his
question whether I thought the instrument would entirely
suit me, I assured him that it was a violin the
tone of which could be graded in all different colors,
and that I was in love with it. He then offered it to me
at the price he paid for it (800 thalers); an offer I
immediately accepted. A German musician, Lansberg
by name, had been living in Rome for some twenty
years, and had there made a collection of ancient violins.
At his death, these were sent to his home in
Breslau. The Amtmann Zoller purchased about a dozen
of them, and among these was the Gaspar da Salo.
Since I purchased this violin I have used it in all my
public concerts.</p>

<p>I have another violin by a maker contemporaneous
with Gaspar da Salo&#8212;in all probability Matteo Bente,
Brescia, 1580. It very much resembles my concert
violin in the model and <i>f</i> holes. I received it in Rome
in 1835, from the librarian of the Vatican, Michael
Angelo Lanzi. During my stay in Rome I had given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
some lessons to a boy who was a favorite of his, and
who had some talent for playing. As a return, he
presented me this violin from the Vatican. In the
Vatican vocal music only was given, and formerly violins
and basses and violas were used in training the
choir&#8211;boys. Of late years, this method falling out of
use, the instruments gradually found their way into the
hands of performers. I have not used this violin in concerts.
It has a very peculiar flute&#8211;like tone, not capable
of great variety of expression, but always in the whole
range or compass preserving the same character. Nor
is it capable of filling a large hall. The small turns of
the <i>f</i> holes are very near together, the large ones correspondingly
far apart. This nearness of the upper
turns necessitates a narrow bridge, which interferes
with the development of a great tone. It is evidently
specially adapted for playing in company with flutes,
guitars, mandolins, and other soft&#8211;toned instruments.</p>


<h4>MY NICHOLAS AMATI.</h4>

<p>I purchased this instrument in London in the year
1861. It had belonged to Sir W. Curtis, a director of
the East India Company.</p>

<p>There is an anecdote of George the Fourth, that, as
he played the violoncello, and wanted a quartette by
Amati, and of course of the best, he applied to Sir W.
Curtis, who sometimes played with him, and was financially
his creditor in large sums. On the king&#8217;s inquiring
if he would sell his violin, he replied that his majesty
could not afford to buy it, as he did not wish to
see him sink deeper in debt. From Sir W. Curtis the
violin passed into the hands of a Mr. Oliphant, also an
East India director. I purchased it from his son. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
Plowden, of London, a violin collector of great judgment,
was much annoyed on finding I had become the
owner of the violin. He pronounced it the finest specimen
of Nicholas Amati in the world, and declared that
he had waited forty years for the chance of being its
possessor. He further offered in its place the choice of
any two violins from his collection.</p>


<h4>THE BRIDGE.</h4>

<p>The position of the bridge should be such as to affect
the whole violin equally, and not to favor one tone more
than another. The centre of the bridge should be always
directly over the centre line of the top. Whether
it should stand slightly backwards or forwards of, or
directly on a line drawn across the top from the inner
notches of the <i>f</i> holes, will depend upon the character
of the instrument, and can only be determined experimentally.
It should incline toward the tail&#8211;piece in order
to better withstand the forward pull of the strings
in tuning.</p>

<p>The construction of the bridge has great influence
upon the tone. Thinness of the centre of the bridge
tends to make prominent any nasal quality or shrillness
latent in the instrument. A proper solidity conveys
sweetness and compactness, but too great thickness
muffles the tone.</p>

<p>High&#8211;built violins mostly require low bridges, and
such should be particularly thick at the edges where
the strings rest.</p>

<p>The bridge should be perfectly flat on the side toward
the tail&#8211;piece. It may be slightly convex on the other
side.</p>

<p>The material of which the bridge is made should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
invariably maple. That which is known as the silver&#8211;gray
maple is preferable to the brown or yellow, as having
a more close and elastic grain.</p>

<p>The incisions in the sides of the bridge should extend
each one third of the distance toward the centre. The
French model of Aubert of Mirecourt, though open to
some objections in special cases, is one of the best.
These bridges are made of excellent wood, and are thick
and strong.</p>

<p>The top of the bridge should be thick. Properly constructed,
a bridge may be made quite heavy, and so
made it will always convey a rounder and fuller volume
of tone. The distance measured along the top, between
the G and the E strings, should be 1&#8211;10/32 inches. The G
string should be 8/32 of an inch above the finger&#8211;board at
its larger extremity; the E string, 5/32 of an inch. The
average height of the feet of the bridge should be about
3/16 of an inch. The thickness at the base, a scant 5/32 of
an inch; at the top, a full 1/16 of an inch. The feet
should be 7/16 of an inch long.</p>


<h4>THE SOUND&#8211;POST.</h4>

<p>In general, the sound&#8211;post should stand from 1/8 to 1/4 of
an inch to the rear of the right foot of the bridge. Its
outer edge should be in line with the outer edge of the
foot. From this position its upper or lower end, or
both, may be moved with advantage to secure certain
qualities of tone. It should in all cases fit the curves
of the top and back absolutely. Moving the lower end
toward the centre favors the lower strings. If the lower
strings are weak and the upper at all sharp or hard in
tone, then a very loose post should be used. If the reverse
is the case, a long and tightly fitting sound&#8211;post is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
required. Moving the upper end outward will help all
the strings, if the tone before was hard and shrill; but
if the upper strings happen to be dull and heavy, then
the post should stand a little inside the line of the foot
of the bridge, and a little further back. The sound&#8211;post
should be made of fine&#8211;grained soft spruce. The grain
should cross that of the top, as this will prevent the
marring of the inner surface of the top in putting the
post in and adjusting it.</p>


<h4>THE BOW.</h4>

<p>I use a bow longer by two inches than the ordinary
standard. A powerful, heavy bow is required for four&#8211;string
passages and many <i>tours de force</i>. The bow,
while elastic, should be extremely stiff, so that if
dropped upon the strings the rebounds are very rapid.
It should have weight to give force to these rebounds,
as in many passages the weight of the hand cannot be
applied to assist the bow; as in the tremolo, arpeggio,
and staccato volante. In this last example the bow is
thrown upon the strings and runs its length in a series
of little rebounds, neither the fingers nor wrist having
anything to do with the result. In order to graduate,
as it were, the different colors of sound, we favor certain
overtones by causing the hair to act at greater or
less distances from the bridge. The nearer we approach
the bridge the more the upper overtones, and
the nearer the neck the more the lower overtones will
be favored. In the first instance, the resulting tone resembles
that of the trumpet; and in the second, that of
the horn and clarinet. With a heavy bow, in forte passages,
only slight assistance is needed from the hand.
The wrist is not cramped or stiffened in producing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
pressure. In piano passages, the little finger should
partially sustain the weight, and the stick should be inclined
toward the neck, so that only part of the hairs
act upon the strings.</p>

<p>The great stiffness and elasticity of the heavy bow
gives a freer, clearer tone than can be produced by one
of a lighter and more sluggish nature.</p>

<p>The length of the bow is two feet, six inches; the
length of the hair two feet, four inches. The number
of hairs is about one hundred and sixty. Half of the
hairs are put in one way, the other half the other. It
is known that the hairs, as seen when magnified, have
little sawlike teeth running in one direction. By thus
dividing the hairs, they present the same friction on
either the up or down stroke. The best hair is from
Normandy. It should be round and even, and not flat
in places.</p>


<h4>THE BAR.</h4>

<p>The principal object of the bar is to resist the pressure
of the strings upon the top. All old violins require
to be rebarred, owing to the height of the present
musical pitch over that of one hundred years ago. The
old short bars are no longer adapted to the greater
strain, and more powerful ones are needed. From long
continued strain, the pulling of the two extremes toward
the centre, and the downward pressure of the
bridge at that point, the tops of many old violins have
bulged up at the ends and sunk down in the centre.
The adjustment of a new bar will have a tendency to
remedy this. As the bar was originally placed by Gaspar
da Salo, so it should be placed now; that is, not in
the direction of the fibres of the top, but obliquely, the
end under the finger&#8211;board being nearest the centre.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
In this position it appears to give ample support to the
bridge and to allow a fuller and richer tone.<a name="Anchor-30" id="Anchor-30"></a><a href="#Footnote-30" class="Anchor" title="Go to footnote 30.">[30]</a></p>


<h4>THE VARNISH.</h4>

<p>In a search after an elucidation of this so&#8211;called lost
art, three facts immediately present themselves: first,
this varnish was employed by the very earliest of the
Italian makers as well as the later; second, its use was
common only in Italy; third, it ceased to be applied to
violins after <span class="smcap lowercase">A. D.</span> 1750&#8211;1760.</p>

<p>In texture this varnish is extremely supple; it will
yield to pressure, but breaks or scales off under a sudden
blow. It is entirely transparent, and of all shades
of brown, red, and yellow. The vehicle in which the
gums and colors are dissolved is an oil. Applied to a
violin, it compacts the tone together, without rendering
it shrill or harsh, and gives additional beauty to the
wood. That its ingredients were indigenous to the Italian
soil is out of the question. It is well known that
much of the maple used by the violin&#8211;makers of that day
came from Turkey. Imported to Venice, it was employed
in the construction of oars, etc. The extremely
curly pieces, owing to their liability to fracture under
rough usage, were consequently rejected, to be appropriated
by the violin&#8211;makers. Venice and Genoa held
great command over the entire Eastern trade, and undoubtedly
through these ports came the various gums
and coloring substances of which this varnish was made.</p>

<p>Turning to other countries of Europe&#8212;Germany,
France, and England&#8212;and examining the productions
of their most celebrated violin&#8211;makers contemporaneous
with the Cremonese school, scarcely a trace of the Italian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
varnish is to be met with. In German instruments,
the varnish is distinguished by extreme hardness, a
glassy lustre, and an absence of all delicate shades of
color. The vehicle or menstruum, moreover, is alcohol.
In France, the coloring was sometimes good, but in
general too pronounced. The varnish of the old English
makers lacked transparency. In both these countries
the vehicle was oil, but the varnish in quality and
texture differed essentially from the Italian.</p>

<p>Three questions occur: first, was this manufacture a
secret? second, how was this secret lost? third, are
there any writings or clues for perusal and examination?
Answers to these questions should clear up the
mystery of this so&#8211;called lost art.</p>

<p>To begin, then, with the first question, was the manufacture
of this varnish a secret? There is no reasonable
doubt that it was, but only in a certain way. For
a period of about two hundred years, from the time of
Gaspar da Salo to that of the Bergonzi, the varnish
was common to every Italian violin&#8211;maker. Cremona
had no monopoly, for the knowledge and use of it extended
to Padua, Venice, Rome, and Naples. It is impossible,
therefore, during this long time to say that the
selection of ingredients or the methods of preparation
employed in the manufacture of this substance, so well
known and widely used, were in any sense a secret. But
a little later quite a change is observable. From a hundred
Italian instruments of this later date, only a notable
few can be selected as possessing the true varnish;
and that this marked characteristic in the case of these
few is not the result of mere chance is apparent from
the fact that the artists who made them have consistently
applied it to all their productions. From about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
1745 to about 1760, then, the manufacture of this varnish
may be properly called a secret, as being confined
to a chosen few.</p>

<p>A bitter rivalry had always existed between the Neapolitan,
Venetian, and Cremonese schools. Alessandro
Gagliano, probably a pupil of Stradivarius, had established
himself at Naples. Dominico Montagnana and
Sanctus Seraphino were the masters of the art in Venice.
The Cremonese makers seem to have relied on
their sonorous, well selected wood, their established
principles of construction, and their ancient reputation;
the Venetian, on the beauty of their wood, and careful
finish; and the Neapolitan, on their exceedingly low
price.</p>

<p>As a knowledge of the varnish became at last confined
to a few, instances are not wanting of the persecution
of such by their less fortunate fellow&#8211;workmen.
It is quite evident, that, apart from any considerations
of beauty, the importance of the varnish as an acoustic
element was well recognized.</p>

<p>The second question now presents itself: how was
the secret lost? A careful and repeated examination,
extending to a vast number of objects, reveals the fact
that the varnish of the Italian violin&#8211;maker of the time
of Stradivarius and before him was common to the
painter, the varnisher, and the gilder as well. Let an ancient
piece of Italian furniture&#8212;a chair, a cabinet, the
case of a spinet or harpsichord&#8212;be examined, and, provided
it has escaped modern retouching, the varnish
might be by Stradivarius himself. Generally it is colorless,
then the quality and texture are the indications;
but occasionally it is of brilliant hues, and then it proclaims
itself to the eye at once. Let specimens of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
later date, say 1760, be examined; here is no such varnish.
This is smooth, fairly lustrous, hard, and durable.
The chair of 1725 presents a surface broken and
worn away; that of 1760, one comparatively smooth,
and fairly able to endure further vicissitudes of time.</p>

<p>Between the years 1740 and 1760, great changes in
the manufacture of varnish were introduced. The old
soft gums and their menstrua, capable in themselves of
dissolving them, were discarded in favor of newer and
more complicated processes, producing a result more
durable and unchangeable under exposure and rough
wear.</p>

<p>The old fashion of ornamenting all articles of furniture,
whether of ornament or utility, with carvings, had
given place to a more sober style. Broad, unrelieved
surfaces, depending on the intrinsic beauty of their material,
were found a relief to the eye tired with unraveling
the mazes of complex carving or painted arabesque.
The old, soft, badly wearing varnish no longer sufficed
for protection and covering of such surfaces; hence the
new processes, and, for such utilitarian purposes, superior
results. The hard copal gums, hitherto undissolvable
or only partially so, were found to yield entirely on
proper heating and fusion. In 1750, a patent, covering
a period of twenty&#8211;five years, was granted by the King
of France to one Simon Martin, a fan painter, for a
process of making varnish from amber, by driving off
the succinic acid by means of heat, and the subsequent
combination of the residue with oil. From that day to
the present, various improvements in this art have gone
on uninterruptedly. The field of discovery, the gates to
which were opened by such pioneers as Simon Martin,
being once entered, the problem of durability, hardness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
and unchangeableness was soon solved. But with the
laying aside of the old receipts, the Italian violin varnish
became a lost art. The knowledge of its composition,
naturally confined to the general manufacturers,
was forgotten. There is no doubt that some of the Cremonese
and other makers knew how to prepare it, but,
as has been shown, its use was not confined to them.
The new ingredients&#8212;the copals, amber, etc.&#8212;would
naturally supersede the old as articles of import, and so
by degrees those who possessed the secret&#8212;for a secret
it was certainly regarded by its latest possessors&#8212;would
find increasing difficulty in obtaining the old constituents.
Moreover, the days of violin&#8211;making in Italy
were over. England, France, and Germany were eager
competitors; the stolid build of the first, the gaudy color
of the second, the baked wood of the Mittenwalder, or
artist of the Black Forest, and the general cheapness of
all, held the market. And so it has happened that the
art of the old varnish is not lost, but buried in the dust
under the wheel of progress. For two hundred years it
was in the hands of a nation; and though now a desire
for this forgotten knowledge is confined to only a few,
it would be absurd to say that persistent inquiry must
fail to unravel a skein of so many ends.</p>

<p>The third question now presents itself: Are there
any writings or clues for perusal and examination?
There are many. An ingenious Frenchman, who long
ago wrote a treatise on varnish, has given the following
excellent list of authors who have treated upon this
subject:&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alexis,&#8221; Piedmontese [real name of author, Hieronymus
Ruscella&#299;]: <span lang="fr">Secrets des Arts</span>; Milan, 1550.</p>

<p>Fiavoranti: <span lang="fr">Miroir Universel des Arts et des Sciences</span>;
Bologna, 1564.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>Auda: <span lang="fr">Recueil Abrégé des Secrets Merveilleux</span>;
&#8212;&#8212;, 1663.</p>

<p>Zahn, Jean: <span lang="la">Oculus Artificialis</span>, etc.; Nuremberg,
1685.</p>

<p>Morley, C.: Collections; London, 1692.</p>

<p>Coronelli, Vincent: <span lang="fr">Epitome Cosmographique</span>; Venice,
1693.</p>

<p>Pomet: <span lang="fr">Histoire Générale des Drogues</span>; Paris, 1694
(reprinted, 1736).</p>

<p>Buonanni, Phillipe: <span lang="fr">Traité des Vernis</span>; Rome, 1713.</p>

<p>Here is a succession of treatises, the earliest written
about the time of Gaspar da Salo, and the latest during
that of Stradivarius. Here are hundreds of genuine
receipts. Is any one of them the right one? Patience
and perseverance are necessary, much fitting of old
names to their new nomenclatures, and many tiresome
comparisons. But these once made, the desired result
may be obtained, and the new varnish may possess the
old coveted lustrous softness and suppleness. And the
colors? the brown, the red, and the yellow?&#8212;hidden
under quaint and obsolete names, they are all indicated
by one and another of these authors, and all are soluble
in the one vehicle, forming a colored oil varnish, clear
and transparent, which, however long kept, will let fall
no sediment.</p>

<p>There is still another branch of this subject which
has never, or very rarely, been specified, and this is the
<i>ground&#8211;toning</i>. In all Italian instruments the wood appears
to be permeated with a color varying in intensity
from pale yellow to almost orange. This color is quite
distinct from that of the varnish; for, however faded
by exposure and other causes the latter may be, the
ground&#8211;tone almost always retains its color. The violins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
with red varnish afford the finest examples of this
ground&#8211;toning. On such, its tawny yellow is the most
intense, and offers a splendid foil to the superimposed
color, toning and giving life to it. How it was composed
or applied, whether as a wash or stain, or as a
distinct varnish, none of the authors give any information.
But from their miscellaneous lists of the drugs,
dye&#8211;stuffs, and coloring matters common to the Italian
markets, it is quite possible that a selection could be
made which would fulfill all the required conditions of
color and stability.</p>

<p>But though supplied with the ground&#8211;tone, another
element is needed before the exact reflex of the Italian
varnish can be reproduced; and that is the natural
color of the old wood.</p>

<p>The problem of the old varnish is solvable by any
one who deems the reward worth the trial of patience
and perseverance, two elements most effective in the
task of interlining the broken sentences of tradition.</p>


<h4>PAGANINI.</h4>

<p>No one can thoroughly understand Paganini without
an educated appreciation of melody and the art of giving
life and expression to it. Without a knowledge of
the Italian art of singing, it is impossible to properly
appreciate his playing. Contemporary with Pasta, Pizzaroni,
Rubini, Malibran, Paganini rivaled them, singing
on his violin melodies, many of which had been
sung by those artists, and astonishing even <i>them</i> more
than the public. In fact, his style was so original, and
the means by which he produced his stirring effects was
so varied and so unexpected, his music so filled with
ever new episodes of startling beauty or original quaintness,
that the violinists of the day stood confounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<p>Half the conceited virtuosos would not condescend to
study the mysteries of the violin and the soul of melody,
or his principles of fingering and manifold colors of
tone and expression, but called all they could not comprehend
and themselves execute &#8220;tricks&#8221; and &#8220;playing
for the multitude.&#8221; Nothing has been produced equaling
his twenty&#8211;four &#8220;Studies,&#8221; either in beauty, originality,
or difficulty of performance. They stand unrivaled.
Liszt has arranged many of them for the piano
in a most masterly manner. He became so inspired on
hearing Paganini, that he composed a fantasia on the
main theme of his &#8220;Rondo Campanella.&#8221; In his obituary
notice of Paganini, published in Paris, he places
him above all virtuosos. As some of Paganini&#8217;s pieces
required the violin to be tuned higher than the normal
pitch, it was necessary that his strings should be thinner
than ordinary to endure the increased strain and
give a free vibration. Tuned in this way, for some effects
they possessed a peculiar timbre and far&#8211;reaching
tone, particularly the G string, which, for some occasions,
he tuned up to C natural. The violinists of that
day used thick strings. They seemed to consider the
greatness and variety of the tone to be a result of sheer
muscular force, and thus loaded the string with a weight
which retarded its vibration. The heavy strings certainly
gave a louder tone, but it was much more gross,
and, besides, required such effort that often the disagreeable
friction of the bow could be distinguished mixed
with the tone. The humidity and heat of the concert&#8211;room
often caused the E string to break in the midst of
a performance. After Paganini had been heard, the
adoption of thinner strings became general.</p>

<p>Paganini&#8217;s style of bowing and producing the tone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
was founded on Tartini&#8217;s exquisite method. He held his
upper arm close to his body, using mainly his lower arm
for the bow stroke, keeping the wrist extremely flexible.
From his peculiar build he could cross his elbows
readily. The elbow of his left arm he brought very
much to the right in playing. This singular flexibility
greatly assisted him in his incredible flights, and made
easy for him passages impossible for another. His
hand was rather small and thin, and the little finger
peculiarly long. The strings of his violin were rather
high from the finger&#8211;board; this enabled him to give
forte passages with great effect, and without the rattling
and false vibration always accompanying force
when applied to strings close to the finger&#8211;board. Owing
to his narrow chest and peculiar way of holding the
violin, it was easy for him to reach the upper notes.
He manipulated the strings at the upper end of the
finger&#8211;board as easily as other violinists could in the first
position. His bow was made after the old Italian style,
of a somewhat later shape than that of Tartini&#8217;s. When
strained to the proper tension, the stick was nearly
straight. Vuillaume, when he saw this bow, laughed
and inquired who could play with such a thing. When
Paganini brought it to him to be repaired (he had
broken the upper end), Vuillaume offered to make him
another, but he was much displeased with the idea, and
most decidedly declined the gift, saying he could not
think of using any other bow. Paganini especially excelled
in giving life to the simplest melodies, in giving
to his tone the quality of the human voice; in contrasts
of light and shade, and expression, now plaintive,
now brilliant and gay, now fantastic. He was unequaled
in producing pizzicatos with the left hand, arpeggio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
passages, the tremolo, and the gettato. He was
the first to establish the rules of artificial harmonic playing,
and his numerous passages in single and double harmonics
attest the wonderful skill with which he applied
them.</p>

<p>In his time it was demanded of artists that they
should not only play the compositions of the masters
with elegance and nobility of style, but also should be
equal to any emergency and ready to improvise embellishments
and harmonious variations. Before Rossini
no composer wrote out the cadenzas, rather leaving
them to the talent of the artist.</p>

<p>The report, circulated in Vienna, that he was a mere
charlatan, preceded Paganini&#8217;s first appearance in that
city. So unfavorable an impression had been formed of
him that his first concert was but poorly attended. But
at the end of the first part, the impression he made
upon his few listeners was so great that several of the
musicians in the audience ran out into the coffee&#8211;houses
and hotels, exclaiming enthusiastically that he was a
perfect marvel, and that all must come to hear him. The
result was that at the performance of the second part
the house was nearly full. Afterwards, partly from
wonder, and partly from jealousy, all sorts of stories
were told about him. It was said that when his mother
died, he made her breathe her last breath into his violin;
that he was a culprit who had spent years in imprisonment
with only his violin for a companion; that
he had gradually worn out all the strings but the G,
hence his wonderful skill in playing anything on that
one string. It seemed of little avail that he procured
and published official testimonials from his native town
to the effect that he had never been in prison. Nor did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
he put an end to the story of his mother&#8217;s death, by
publishing a letter from her, showing that she was still
living.</p>

<p>At a soirée given by Troupenas, the music publisher,
in Paris, in 1830, Paganini gave one of the most wonderful
exhibitions of his skill. Rossini, Tamburini, Lablache,
Rubini, De Beriot, and Malibran were of the
party. Malibran, after singing one of her spirited arias,
challenged Paganini, who said &#8220;Madam, how could I
dare, with all the advantages you possess in beauty and
your incomparable voice, take up your glove?&#8221; His declining
was of no avail; the whole company, aware that
such an opportunity might never occur again, urged him
most strongly, and finally persuaded him to send for
his violin. After an introduction, in which gleamed
now and then the motive of Malibran&#8217;s song, he gave
the whole melody with additional <i>fiorituras</i>, so that the
audience, amazed and overwhelmed, could not help confessing
that he was the master. I heard this from
several of the persons who were present, and Malibran
herself was the most emphatic of all in proclaiming
him the victor.</p>

<p>Paganini&#8217;s last Parisian concert occurred in the year
1832, at the Grand Opéra. He played three pieces.
Habeneck, professor of music at the Conservatoire,
on this occasion wielded the bâton. He had been instrumental
in introducing the symphonies of Beethoven
for the first time, in opposition to the opinions of
the other professors of the Conservatoire. The orchestra
was composed of the professors, and such pupils
as had taken the first prize; it was justly regarded
as the finest orchestra in Europe. Habeneck wished
to introduce Beethoven, but had hitherto failed in exciting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
an appreciation for his mighty works. Finally
he hit upon a strategem. It was his birthday, and he
invited the members of the orchestra to a collation to
be given in the concert&#8211;hall of the Conservatoire, and
he begged them to bring their instruments. When
his health was proposed, he suggested in response
that, if they really wished to give him great joy, they
would consent to play the &#8220;Allegro in C minor&#8221; from
the first symphony of Beethoven. He explained to
them beforehand how he would have them handle the
principal motive. Of course all agreed. He knew his
success from the manner in which they struck the
first chords. Exclamations of admiration followed the
close of the Allegro, and the concluding movement of
the symphony was played with enthusiasm to the end.
Now they requested that the symphony should be
played at the next concert, and after twenty rehearsals
it was given with immense success. Such was the man
who conducted on this occasion. He was a leader of
great ability, and the players, the majority of them
graduates of the Conservatoire, were entirely under
his command. Paganini played, as far as I can remember,
his &#8220;Concerto in B minor,&#8221; with the &#8220;Rondo
Campanella,&#8221; also two variations of Haydn&#8217;s famous
&#8220;Austrian National Hymn,&#8221; and concluded with his
&#8220;Moto Perpetuo.&#8221; The public were accustomed to
applaud (I have the whole scene before me as if it were
to&#8211;day) when he appeared at the side. When his
shadow was seen approaching, the audience applauded
as usual, but to their astonishment Paganini did not
appear, but instead a man in black, with a music&#8211;stand,
which he placed on the stage near the conductor.
Again a shadow was seen on the wall, and again the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
applause sounded. A man appeared clad in livery; he
bore two candles, which he placed on the stand and
lighted. He disappeared, amid the laughter of the
audience. Then came the first fellow in black, this
time with a manuscript in his hand. The house behaved
as before, evidently confusing the black fellow. Finally
came another shadow, and this time it was Paganini,
but the applause was now withheld, and he was not
recognized until he came forward to the foot&#8211;lights.
There he made a forced salutation, accompanied with a
contraction of the facial muscles, seeming much puzzled
at his silent reception. He had been in another room,
and knew nothing of the ludicrous scene which had
preceded his appearance. Immediately Habeneck raised
his bâton, as if to give his order to the orchestra, but
Paganini shook his head. He took his bow in his left
hand together with his violin, and thrust his right into
the recesses of the pockets of his swallow&#8211;tailed coat,
and brought out a pair of dark&#8211;green gloves, which he
transferred to his left hand. He shook his head again,
and, after a deeper plunge, produced a large white handkerchief,
which he also placed in his left hand, accompanying
the action with an audible expression of dissatisfaction.
A still deeper thrust revealed a brown
box, which he regarded with a nod and a smile, and
added to the other things in his left hand. He now
went through the same deliberate motions in passing
the handkerchief and gloves back to his pocket. He
then opened the box and took out a pair of spectacles,
meditated a moment, apparently considering the next
move, and finally, taking the bow in his right hand, and
bending a little, put the spectacles on and looked about
in a complacent manner. But how changed he was!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
The glasses were dark blue, giving a ghastly appearance
to his emaciated face; they looked like two large holes
in his countenance. Raising his foot and bringing it
down promptly, he gave the signal to begin. It had
been announced as his last concert in Paris for the season,
and a true foreboding seemed to thrill through his
listeners that they would not again see that lank, angular
figure, with its haggard face, or hear again the wondrous
witchery of his violin.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&#8212;(Page <a href="#Page_363">363</a>). The oblique position of the bar has not
been generally adopted. The bar is ordinarily placed with its outer
side on a line parallel to the centre line or glue&#8211;joint of the top,
and at a distance from it about equal to one half the width of the
bridge, measured from the outer extremities of the feet. A slight
spring is given to the ends of the bar, so that when glued to the
top it produces an upward pressure at the centre, under the foot of
the bridge. This pressure should equal the downward thrust of
the bridge, the force of which will depend upon the angle of the
strings over its top. Practice soon discovers a certain modicum of
spring which agrees fairly with a certain height of bridge. An
entirely successful result is not always insured, but a positive failure
is avoided. But in the case of the oblique bar, no such common
factor can be found to fit all cases even averagely well. Each
instrument presents its own particular problem. The spring at
each end must be accurately determined by mechanical means,
which will take into account both the resistance of the top, due to
its comparative strength of fibre, and the resistance due to the form
of modeling. The same degree of obliquity, and position relative
to the foot of the bridge which it supports, will not answer equally
well in all cases. But when the required conditions are fulfilled,
the oblique bar does, beyond doubt, very greatly increase the depth
and volume of tone, particularly of the lower strings. Mr. Bull
spent many years in endeavoring to formulate the rules which govern
this most perplexing part of the organism of the violin. His
observations and experiments demonstrated to him the correctness
of the oblique position; and though, as was his wont, he frankly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
owned to more failures than one, his instances of success, illustrated
by his Da Salo and many other instruments, bore most convincing
witness to the truth of his theory.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Walter E. Colton.</span></p>

<p>Ole Bull, in the last interview which he had with Mr. Colton, said
to him: &#8220;You have the tools, the knowledge, and the time for this
work, and you will be able to give at last a rule by which less skilled
workmen may be guided in the placing of the oblique bar.&#8221; After
Mr. Colton had sent the above note, a query addressed to him
brought the following response, which it is hoped he will pardon us
for printing, as it gives just what ought to be known in order to
save violins from being injured in the hands of ordinary workmen
claiming to understand the principle of the oblique bar:&#8212;</p>

<p>The second attempt in placing the bar would be, in the hands of
the ordinary repairer, nearly as much of an experiment as the first.
In the first place, he lacks the apparatus for determining the spring.
In regard to the position relative to the foot of the bridge and degree
of obliquity, these appear to be governed by the height of
the top and thickness of material. The higher the top, the more
the obliquity; the thicker the top, the more the bar can be removed
from under the foot of the bridge. I presume I have placed a hundred
bars, and have used up many cheap violins in trying to arrive
at something like a governing principle, and even now the first attempt
may not be all I could wish. Mr. Bull, aided by his own experience,
and by some marvelous intuition, compared to which the
knowledge of the average repairer is mere clodhopperism, appeared
to be able to determine the requirements of an instrument submitted
to him. One reason why I did not speak more strongly in favor
of the general adoption of the oblique position was because, apart
from the spring, the ratio of which and means of determining it I
believe I have settled, I could not lay down a positive and definite
rule regarding the place and degree of obliquity which would apply
to all cases. So I did not like to advocate on my own account, or
by inference, that of Mr. Bull, the immediate advisability of an operation
the result of which might be in any way doubtful. When
I think of the horror with which the connoisseur contemplates even
the idea of removing the top of his valued instrument, I feel that,
beyond sticking stoutly to the truth of Mr. Bull&#8217;s theory, I am not
in a condition to competently advise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Bull&#8217;s second attempts were almost always successful. I
honestly think I should not fail more than once. But if I say this,
I am calling attention to my own work, Mr. Bull having passed
away, when it belongs to him.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Chin&#8211;Rest.</span>&#8212;This particular form of chin&#8211;rest was an
entirely original invention of Mr. Bull. It prevents all unavoidable
contact of the violin with the body, and at the same time is
itself attached to a point of minimum vibration, the tail&#8211;pin block.
Its use shows perfectly the deadening effect of the pressure of the
chin upon the top over the end of the bar, and upon the tail&#8211;piece,
and also that of the chest and shoulder upon the back. In the original
form, the chin&#8211;rest and tail&#8211;pin were one. A small rib should
run along the tail&#8211;pin, and an appropriate slot should be cut in the
hole for its reception. This prevents any possibility of the chin&#8211;rest&#8217;s
turning upon the pin while playing. Mr. Bull designed separating
the pin and rest by making the former with a square instead
of round head, and fitting the latter over it, a screw with a wide flat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
head and leather washer securing the two parts. In this way the
rest could be removed without the disagreeable necessity of unstringing
the violin. Each rest ought to be specially made for the
violin it is to be applied to. This, and the necessity of some enlargement
of the violin&#8211;case, are the two possible drawbacks to its
general manufacture.</p>

<h4>FROM PHILIP GILBERT HAMERTON.</h4>

<p>The following, from Mr. Hamerton&#8217;s &#8220;Thoughts
about Art,&#8221; is an appropriate commentary on the advice
that Ole Bull used to give the artist, &#8220;Play little,
and think much:&#8221;&#8212;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Thus it is said that Ole Bull, the celebrated Norwegian
violinist, arrived at his most wonderful effects less by manual
practice than meditation. He practiced less and thought
more than other violinists. This is quite in keeping with his
reflections after hearing Paganini. Ole Bull actually sold his
last shirt to hear the mighty master, and, having heard him,
instead of saying like the crowd that nothing new was possible
after that, began to seek after hitherto unknown effects
that even Paganini had not discovered. Both these facts indicate
clearly that Ole Bull was a musical transcendentalist,
and his long retirement confirms it. A true transcendentalist
dislikes publicity, and loves to cultivate himself in solitude.</p></div>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;O for the touch of a vanished hand</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the sound of a voice that is still!&#8221;</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>Remarkable as Ole Bull was as an artist, he was no less
so in his social intercourse. His nature was eminently
sympathetic. He not only liked his friends, but he
loved them. His manners were gentle and affectionate;
his presence in a room filled it with sunshine.</p>

<p class="break">It was said of the French author, Villemain, that
when he spoke to a lady, you would think he was presenting
her a bouquet. With equal truth might it be
said of Ole Bull, so gracious was he and so amiable in
his conversation.</p>


<h4>OLE BULL.</h4>

<p class="center">BY JAMES T. FIELDS.</p>

<p>It is nearly forty years since I was first introduced to
one of the most genial and delightful men I have ever
chanced to know. I distinctly recall the sunny morning
when I made Ole Bull&#8217;s acquaintance and began a
friendship that was never dimmed during all that long
period. Years would intervene when I lost sight of
him and knew nothing of his whereabouts, but when
he returned from Norway or Italy or Russia, we came
together as if we had never parted company for a day.
Often when in Boston he made our home his resting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
place, and his advent was a delight to us all. He
brought sunshine with him, and in the words of the old
song&#8212;</p>

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;His very foot had music in &#8217;t,</span><br />
<span class="i0">When he came up the stair.&#8221;</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>His conversation had that indefinable flavor in it which
we call <i>charm</i>, flowing on and on with indescribable
magnetism. To hear him picture with glowing enthusiasm
his home in Norway among the fjords, his early
days while studying his art, his adventures in the capitals
of Europe before his fame had been secured, his
various voyages about the world, the celebrated men
and women he had known in musical and social walks
in every corner of the globe, was a never&#8211;failing pleasure.
Often, far into midnight, we sat and listened to
his reminiscences of Paganini, Malibran, Rubini, Lablache,
Liszt, and numerous other distinguished artists,
and we never heeded the clock, when he was fairly
warmed into enthusiasm by his exciting themes. Ole
Bull was an <i>eloquent</i> talker <i>par excellence</i>&#8212;one of the
most vivifying companions I have ever been intimate
with. I carried him one evening many years ago to a
scientific club, and asked him to say something to its
members about the construction and makers of the violin.
When the president called upon him he modestly
rose with the instrument in his hand, and discoursed in
a conversational tone for half an hour, so captivating
his auditors that they would not allow him to stop, although
there were several other speakers on the evening&#8217;s
programme expecting to be heard. Every one
was charmed, and to this day the memory of that exceptional
appearance at the club is still recalled with
the warmest interest.</p>

<p>Ole Bull was not a man of negations. His likings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
and dislikings were positive and not always settled by
the wisest judgment, but his leaning was habitually
toward the simplest and straight&#8211;forward in all things.
He said to me once of a person I was inclined to have
him like, &#8220;Yaas! but he always seems to be behind a
corner, peeping round when he should be in front!&#8221;
He was a delightful mimic, not one of the ungenial,
critical sort, but full of impulsive vivacity, eager to impart
clear and dramatic impressions of character. No
book of travels in the North of Europe ever conveyed
to me so graphic a presentation of the manners and
customs of the people as his personal sketches, acted
out on the parlor floor, of the way in which the inhabitants
in cities and villages danced and sang, marched in
festive processions, held their fairs, ate their meals, and
lived their daily lives. When he thought his voice was
not conveying the impression he desired to impart, he
would seize his violin and cause that to speak for him
in the most picturesque and engaging manner.</p>

<p>He was a spiritual&#8211;minded thinker, a sayer of deep
things, as well as of witty and merry ones. No man
had a finer sense of the mysteries of human life, or
could discourse of them more earnestly. The love of
liberty was a passion with him, and when he chanted of
Freedom his countenance was as of one inspired. It
would be superfluous to repeat here what rapturous
pleasure Ole Bull&#8217;s music has afforded to hundreds of
thousands in America during the many years he lived
among us.</p>

<p>To me he was always a magician and I yielded to his
skill whenever he chose to command me. He was an
enchanter&#8212;a bright, eager, imaginative spirit. He was
a companion, lovable, and unparagoned: his absence
from those who knew him best can never be supplied.</p>

<h4>FROM MRS. JULIA WARD HOWE.</h4>

<p>Mrs. Howe, whose acquaintance Ole Bull had the
pleasure and honor of making at the Woman&#8217;s Congress
in Madison, Wis., the autumn of 1879, sent this warm
tribute:&#8212;</p>

<p>I can contribute a few grateful words concerning his
chivalrous interest in all that regards the welfare of
women, recalling also the great personal charm of his
own companionship.... His death, which was so sincerely
and so publicly mourned in his own country, did
not fail to cast in our midst its shadow of sorrowing
sympathy. In the association of the New England
Women&#8217;s Club, Ole Bull will long be remembered as a
kind friend, as a distinguished artist, and as a personality
unique and charming. He was at once cosmopolitan
and patriotic. He loved his own country, and
loved ours also, which became his by a sort of adoption.
He was a lover at once of art and of humanity,
and deserves a place in the record of those who unite
skill with sympathy, the artist&#8217;s cunning with the frank
loving nature of the child.</p>


<h4>FROM REV. DR. BARTOL&#8217;S MEMORIAL SERMON,
OCTOBER 10, 1880.</h4>

<p>&#8220;I have raised up one from the North.&#8221; Isaiah, xli.
25.&#8212;It is a curious case of the truth of the old Bible
to nature, or rather of the coincidence of the two, that
both make more physical and moral account of the
north point of the compass than of the south. &#8220;Fair
weather,&#8221; saith the book of Job, &#8220;cometh out of the
north;&#8221; and thence, too, in all ages, has come the clearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
of the social sky. All the old prophets and modern
geographical scientists, like Mr. Buckle, agree. The
south, says the old writ, is &#8220;invaded&#8221; with &#8220;whirlwinds&#8221;
and armed men. The upper strong Barbarians
fall upon to purge the dissolute empire of Rome. From
high latitudes come the Scandinavian rovers to be converted
into English lords. From Norway, the north
way, comes Leif Ericson before Columbus to discover
America and have his monument, let us trust, in these
last days; and more than forty years ago, yet in the
memory of many that hear me, Ole Bull, whom his
friend and compeer of kindred genius, the poet and novelist
now among us, Björnstjerne Björnson, calls &#8220;our
greatest citizen,&#8221; at his burial in the land where seventy
years ago he was born, dying in his own house on the
Isle of Light or Lysö of a malignant disease, yet with
little pain and in full possession of his powers till within
a half hour of his expiring breath....</p>

<p>I must not omit my thanks for the delight Ole Bull
gave with his violin at his first coming to this country
more than forty years ago. From the touch of his bow,
as if Neptune were speaking to the sea, a wave swept
over the land from that ocean of harmony that slumbers
in the human soul. Out of the same deeps came a second
wave at the voice, much later among us, of Jenny
Lind. Technical criticism cannot countervail much
when a man has just wrought a miracle on the spot,
and the United States rose to this as, in the same calling,
never to any other man. Young and green then,
as respects concord and melody, we may have been.
The matchless personal grace of the musician, alike at
thirty and three&#8211;score, may have had its part in the
effect. Who that saw it does not remember the appearance
that, as Björnson says, made it here, as well as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
Norway on his return, &#8220;a feast to look at him;&#8221; the
supple sway that was rhythm in his frame, so tall, with
its breadth of shoulder and tapering waist, the firm feet
which the broad platform seemed not worthy to be a
stool for, the arms of wrought steel, more flexible than
willow wands, the face in which, as much as in any
countenance we ever beheld, the smile was a benediction,
and the hair that was tossed about his brow as if
inspired with the unison of the strings; and had he
spoken on the stage where he stood, the whole audience
would have known as well as some of us in private soon
did, that the violin was not, and no instrument made
with hands could be, so sweet as the voice. He was
embodied beauty and an incarnate hymn&#8212;a mesmeric,
irresistible man....</p>

<p>His speech, of which I shall give some samples as
I close, like Anton Rubinstein&#8217;s, was as rare and original
as his notes. He was not, like some people I have
known, marvelous in a performance as of a sermon or
a tune, and, on leaving desk or orchestra, with nought
of interest left, the whole man gone, spent, exploded in
what had been sounded or said. To be a true artist is
a wonderful thing. But into the artist the whole of him,
as of none truly great or good, could not be put....</p>

<p>But musical was with him largely a form of patriotic
feeling, and for love of liberty for himself and all men
he was a living flame. He respected more the nobility
of nature than of political schemes. The pretensions of
barons and earls in England or elsewhere, not backed
up by personal merit, were nought to him, mere ciphers,
deriving all their value from their situation in a column.
In the honest but reactionary King of Norway he had a
social friend; but, in pushing the right assumed of veto
against laws of the Norwegian parliament, this little potentate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
of two or three millions of subjects became his
diplomatic foe; and Ole Bull represented the peasant
population of the kingdom. It was natural he should
sympathize strongly with us against secession and slavery
in our civil war, and he maintained our cause abroad
as warmly as he did in our midst. Like David, he declared
God&#8217;s statute of freedom, &#8220;speaking of his testimonies
before kings and was not ashamed.&#8221;...</p>

<p>It remains to consider Ole Bull not only as an artist
and patriot, but man; for, beyond all else, he was humane,
cosmopolite, a citizen of the world, and did not
distinguish himself, save by genius which he could not
help, from other men, but was in union and close communion
with all; and detract as we may from a man&#8217;s
talents, or criticise as we will his accomplishments, the
fact of a great wide and common love for him and from
him cannot be set aside. He was a magnet. Living
nearer to the North Pole, had he borrowed a bit of the
lodestone that poises the planet? His attraction was
as constant and inexhaustible for the world. A young
man, a natural player, from our rough Cape Ann yonder,
seeks him abroad to get lessons, and Ole welcomes
him at once. &#8220;How did you like him?&#8221; the
young man was asked. &#8220;Like him? I cannot say
enough to tell you.&#8221; Money went from him, as it came,
like wind or water. Being unpractical if not careless
almost to a fault, he was imposed upon by a false title of
land for a Norwegian colony in Pennsylvania; charges
for litigation were added; he had intended to buy a
ship to transport the colonists at his own expense,&#8212;and
out of pocket hundreds of thousands of dollars, he became
poor, sick, and subject to arrest. He said, &#8220;I shall
pursue the swindlers;&#8221; then, reflecting, he remarked:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>&#8220;That is not according to the Master&#8217;s precept, but if I
kiss my enemy what have I left for my friend?&#8221; &#8220;My
friends,&#8221; he said, &#8220;will never defraud me, for they know
I am theirs.&#8221; &#8220;I am not content,&#8221; he told me, &#8220;with
the golden rule, for I cannot expect others to do to me
as I do to them.&#8221; He was not a professor of Christianity
or of religion in any form. He informed me he got
such a shock and revulsion from the doctrines he heard
preached in his youth that he was permanently alienated
from going to church; but so much the worse for
the Christians if they reject and excommunicate him.
He said to me: &#8220;They showed me so many statues and
images, coarse or blood&#8211;colored, in Italy, it made me
sick and I wanted to see a cow!&#8221; Why, I inquired of
him, do the manufacturers of violins not illustrate the
law of evolution, and make as good instruments at least
as Stradivarius, Amati, and Gaspar da Salo? &#8220;Because,&#8221;
he answered, &#8220;they do not consider it a holy
mission.&#8221; Earnest in his nature, like the hot geysers
of the North, he was as winsome in his manners as any
prince of the East; and, I doubt not, a true test would
detect blood of the Orient in his veins, as he said he
learned from Italy what it is to sing. Yet Norway, says
Björnson, gave to his music its theme or ground, and
well does Henrik Wergeland make Norway herself sing
to him.</p>

<p>We must, he one day told me, see our fellow&#8217;s errors
and sins, but often &#8220;not say what we see,&#8221; putting his
long forefinger on his lips as he spoke. He graciously
insinuated, rather than bluntly asserted, what he
thought. At the Chestnut Street club he made a marvelous
speech, in which he praised the curvilinear instead
of direct style of the Spanish tongue. He preferred
suggestion to proposition, as do all the likewise
finely&#8211;strung. But, although he had no dogmas to offer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
never lived one who accredited more the being of God
and immortality of the soul, and the immense superiority
of unseen supernal forces to the seen. Thus he
lived an ideal life, free from mercenary aims, so charming
and enchanting men that his name became a household
word, and the great manager in any city had to
spend little time or means advertising him, if it were in
the air that the magician would come....</p>

<p>Honor, then, in this sacred place, to the man and artist,
Ole Bull. He held a sublime and tricksy, yet utterly
simple bow. If he lifted us, round after round, to
heaven, he could lower us, too, with his art, gently and
safely to the ground.... He displayed wondrous tone&#8211;gyrations,
and never, as with a wooden rule, drew mechanical
parallel lines. He was a troubadour with his
shell. When, like a merryman, he made us laugh, the
expression of his face showed his soul still aloft. He
was no materialist or sensualist, but a spiritualist in the
deepest sense. I judge of men by their treatment of
women; and how refined and grand his bearing was to
the sex is well known in every country our strange and
singular fascinator visited....</p>

<p>I have missed the portrait, I meant, if a facsimile
could be furnished of it for any other man. We sometimes
say of a man he was a paragon, gem, &#8220;one entire
and perfect chrysolite.&#8221; <i>Jean Paul Richter the only</i>,
the Germans say. My subject to&#8211;day is unique. There
never on earth will be another Ole Bull. He was the
diamond called solitaire. The Jews were mistaken
when, in the new teacher, they thought Elias or one of
the old prophets had come again. God does not repeat
himself; genius is a fresh revelation, and never, in just
the same form, descends. Speaking as in the presence
of those to whom companionship, country, and kindred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
blood endeared this man of transcendent stature, yet
with none of our occidental stiffness, so lowly and familiar
that he wanted once with a friend to leave the
chairs and get down on the floor to converse, I should
be bankrupt if at least in this paper money I did not try
to pay my debt. Seventy years of age; the Scripture
term was his prime. He died young in heart and hope,
and friend and housemate declare they cannot think and
do not know him dead, as the tropical sun, suddenly setting,
is not quenched, though leaving all dark behind.
Aspiring and proceeding, despite his gray locks, he
seemed an undeveloped child. Nothing in his mental
constitution was fixed or had grown hard. He had not
subsided from the gush and sparkle of life into the sediment
of a form or stalagmite of a creed. The crystallization
went on unfinished in the upper chambers of his
soul, and had no cavern like the stalactites of the mine
in which to drop. No decay gave hint of an end. There
is sickness, death, but no end. He grew, advanced,
never stopped, nor did the sutures, even at seventy,
quite close over that busy brain. &#8220;To have to work so
at my age!&#8221; said the French painter, Thomas Couture;
but Ole Bull said, &#8220;I should vegetate without new engagements
to fulfill.&#8221; He so lived, therefore, as to convince
us of immortality. I know not of what sovereign
or captain from the North, the hill&#8211;country of Judæa,
Isaiah wrote; but when I think how majestic and gentle
was this head man and leader from our modern Norway,
I give him the tribute of my text, as one might salute
a born deliverer and true king.</p>

<h4>FROM REV. DR. A. McKENZIE&#8217;S SERMON ON
THANKSGIVING DAY, 1880.</h4>

<p>From these men of our own Commonwealth let me
turn to a man of another land, whose venerable and
stately presence has been often seen in our streets;
who has been the citizen of many climes, making his
name a familiar word, and filling the air with melody; a
man who stood before kings and held them in wondering
silence by the witchery of his fingers, and the harmony
of his thoughts; who drew the souls of men after
him by the sound of the mystic strings he touched.
He made to himself a great renown, the music and the
man; both were honored, both were loved. Now the
hands have lost their cunning, and the good, gray head
is seen no more. Yet will he keep his place with all
who knew him. It was among his own people that he
was greatest and best. He loved his country, its men
and women, its mountains and valleys, its rivers and
lakes, its history and its hope. He carried it with him
where he went. He sought its honor and toiled for its
welfare. Loyal and loving, he wore its name upon his
brow. When he stood as one entranced, his tall form
swaying to and fro, his eye gazing far away, and the utter
stillness was scarcely broken by the sweet, weird
strains which floated into it, it was the heart of Norway
we saw and heard, incarnate in her son, beating,
breathing, singing in his spirit.</p>

<p>When he lay wearied and dying in his island&#8211;home
Norway grew still. Spacious and comely was the room
which he had made for song, where the singer rested;
but the land which mourned was wider.</p>

<p>He heard the requiem there, but the land was to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
full of requiem. From off the quiet waters came the
tribute of admiring minstrelsy, which long will be repeated.</p>

<p>When he was gone, royalty and humanity hastened
with their homage to his memory. The great city
begged for his honored form to give it choicest burial.
It lay in state in his own house. It was borne in
grand procession to the distant shore. The walks were
strewed with living green. The people wept and praised.
His trophies went before him, but the stricken hearts of
men were on every side of him. The eloquent words of
friendship and reverence were spoken. He found his
resting&#8211;place among the great, on a spot which had
been kept for a king&#8212;which had found a king.</p>

<p>And he wore no royalty but his great manhood.</p>

<p>Why this honor to a man? Because he had dealt
well by the land. He had given it good and glory, and
the gift returned. Norway loved him because he loved
Norway.</p>

library. A company of the wisest and wittiest men
that could be picked out of all civil countries, in a thousand
years, have set in best order the results of their
learning and wisdom. The men themselves were hid and
inaccessible, solitary, impatient of interruptions, fenced by
etiquette; but the thought which they did not uncover to
their bosom friend is here written out in transparent
words to us, the strangers of another age.</i>&#8212;Ralph

<p><a name="Footnote-1" id="Footnote-1"></a> This story is given as written by Mrs. Lydia Maria Child, who
heard Ole Bull tell it when he first came to the United States. Mrs.
Child always preserved better than any one else his peculiar manner
of narration.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote-2" id="Footnote-2"></a> This is the sole foundation for the absurd story that has appeared
in certain encyclopædias, to the effect that Ole Bull had
killed a fellow&#8211;student in a duel.</p>

had stood by him. &#8220;What are you reading? I know the hand&#8211;writing,&#8221;
said Lablache, looking over Grisi&#8217;s note the very hour of

tenderest of his heart&#8211;ties. He loved, respected, and admired her.
She had from his earliest childhood sympathized with him. At
her knee he learned the folk&#8211;songs and folk&#8211;lore of Norway. Her
teachings influenced his thoughts and life, and to dream of her or
his father gave him great happiness. Her dear face, he used to
say, seemed to be near him when he played his &#8220;Mother&#8217;s Prayer.&#8221;</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
